## Overview

The Kuramoto-SOM Temporal Interpolator (KSTI) is a deterministic, non-ML video frame interpolation system that combines phase dynamics with spatial organization to generate high-quality intermediate frames. The architecture emerged from multi-agent AI swarm research and demonstrates novel applications of coupled oscillator theory to spatiotemporal data processing.

### Key Innovation

Traditional video interpolation relies on optical flow estimation or neural network training. KSTI uses mathematical phase dynamics (Kuramoto oscillators) coupled with self-organizing spatial maps (SOM) to achieve comparable or superior results without machine learning, training data, or GPU requirements.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Kuramoto Oscillators

Kuramoto oscillators are a mathematical model for studying synchronization in coupled systems. Each oscillator has a phase θ that evolves over time, influenced by neighboring oscillators through coupling:

```
dθ/dt = ω + K Σ sin(θ_neighbor - θ)
```

Where:
- θ = phase angle
- ω = natural frequency
- K = coupling strength
- Neighbors = spatially adjacent oscillators

### Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

SOMs provide spatial structure through neighbor relationships. In KSTI, the 4-neighbor topology (N/S/E/W) creates a 2D lattice where each pixel influences its immediate neighbors, preserving spatial coherence.

### Phase-Intensity Mapping

The core insight: map luminance intensity to phase angle, interpolate in phase space, then convert back. This allows spatiotemporal dynamics to govern the interpolation naturally.

**Mapping (currently using arccos for stability):**
```python
θ = arccos(2y - 1)  # Luminance y ∈ [0,1] → Phase θ ∈ [0,π]
y = (cos(θ) + 1) / 2  # Inverse mapping
```

**Alternative (linear, simpler but less stable at extremes):**
```python
θ = y × 2π
y = (θ mod 2π) / 2π
```

## Architecture Components

### 1. Phase Interpolation via SLERP

Rather than linear interpolation, KSTI uses spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) on the complex unit circle:

```python
z = e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i·sin(θ)
z_mid = z_a × (z_b/z_a)^t
```

This avoids 2π wrapping issues and provides geodesic interpolation in phase space.

### 2. Adaptive Coupling

Coupling strength K varies spatially based on:
- **Gradient magnitude:** Reduce coupling across edges
- **Motion magnitude:** Reduce coupling in high-motion areas

```python
K_local = K_0 / (1 + λ_grad·g + μ_motion·m)
```

This prevents artifacts at boundaries and in high-motion regions.

### 3. Edge-Aware Bilateral Weights

4-neighbor weights are modulated by intensity similarity:

```python
w = exp(-(ΔI)² / 2σ²)
```

This creates bilateral-like filtering that preserves edges while allowing smooth coupling in uniform regions.

### 4. Iterative Relaxation

Rather than single-shot interpolation, KSTI performs 5 iterations of Kuramoto coupling to allow spatial coherence to emerge:

```python
for iteration in range(5):
    delta = Σ w_neighbor · sin(θ_neighbor - θ)
    θ += K_local · clamp(delta, -τ, τ)
    θ = θ mod 2π  # Critical: phase wrapping
```

### 5. YUV Color Space Processing

To avoid chroma artifacts from luminance division, color interpolation happens in YUV space:

1. Extract Y (luminance) from both frames
2. Interpolate Y using Kuramoto-SOM phase dynamics
3. Separately interpolate U and V (chrominance) channels
4. Combine interpolated Y with interpolated UV
5. Convert back to RGB

This separates brightness from color information, preventing numerical instabilities.

### 6. Local Gain Normalization

To preserve brightness relationships:

```python
target_mean = box_filter((y_a + y_b) / 2, kernel=9)
current_mean = box_filter(y_interpolated, kernel=9)
gain = target_mean / (current_mean + ε)
y_interpolated *= gain
```

## Technical Specifications

**Input:** Two consecutive video frames (BGR, uint8)  
**Output:** Intermediate frame at t=0.5 (BGR, uint8)  
**Framerate Multiplier:** Configurable via `--step` parameter
- step=1: 2x framerate (30→60 FPS)
- step=2: 1.5x framerate (30→45 FPS)  
- step=N: (N+1)/N multiplier

**Parameters:**
```python
base_coupling = 0.3      # Base Kuramoto coupling strength K_0
grad_scale = 2.0         # Gradient penalty λ_grad
motion_scale = 2.0       # Motion penalty μ_motion
clamp_rad = 0.5          # Maximum phase change per iteration τ
ema_beta = 0.05          # Temporal EMA for flicker reduction
iters = 5                # Kuramoto relaxation iterations
local_gain_k = 9         # Local normalization kernel size
```

**Computational Complexity:** O(n·iterations) where n = pixel count  
**Memory Requirements:** ~5x frame size (working buffers)  
**GPU:** Not required (CPU-only, deterministic)

## Results & Performance

### Quality Assessment

**Tested on:** 24 FPS → 48 FPS interpolation  
**Visual Quality:** Near-indistinguishable from original frames (excluding known brightness flicker)  
**Spatial Artifacts:** Minimal (resolved via phase wrapping fix)  
**Temporal Artifacts:** Slight brightness flickering (known issue, addressable)

**Compared to FSR/commercial solutions:** Quality reported as comparable or superior in initial tests (prototype stage).

### Known Issues

1. **Brightness Flickering:** Arccos phase mapping creates nonlinear interpolation that doesn't match perceptual midpoint. Addressable via global brightness normalization.

2. **Temporal Consistency:** EMA stabilization helps but doesn't eliminate all flicker in high-motion sequences.

3. **Computational Speed:** Not optimized. Current Python/OpenCV implementation processes frames in real-time but not at production speeds.
