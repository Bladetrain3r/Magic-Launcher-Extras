# Kuramoto-SOM Temporal Interpolation
## Phase-Coherent Frame Rate Conversion Using Oscillator Dynamics

### Overview

Kuramoto-SOM Temporal Interpolation is a novel approach to video frame rate conversion that combines Kuramoto oscillator dynamics with Self-Organizing Map principles to create temporally coherent frame interpolation and intelligent frame rate conversion.

Unlike traditional methods that rely on linear blending or optical flow estimation, this approach uses phase synchronization dynamics to maintain temporal coherence while preserving spatial detail through edge enhancement.

## Technical Approach

### Core Algorithm Components

#### **1. Kuramoto Phase Dynamics**
Each pixel region is treated as an oscillator with:
- **Phase state**: `θ(x,y,t)` representing temporal evolution
- **Natural frequency**: Derived from pixel intensity `ω = I(x,y) * α`
- **Coupling**: Synchronization with spatial neighbors

```python
dθ/dt = ω + K * Σ_neighbors sin(θ_neighbor - θ_current)
```

#### **2. Self-Organizing Map Integration**
Spatial feature relationships are preserved through:
- **Local topology preservation**: Similar features cluster spatially
- **Adaptive weighting**: Feature similarity influences interpolation strength
- **Boundary detection**: Phase discontinuities identify edges

#### **3. Temporal Coherence Optimization**
Frame sequences maintain smooth motion through:
- **Phase synchronization**: Oscillators lock to create smooth transitions
- **Edge preservation**: Phase discontinuities enhance rather than blur boundaries
- **Motion-adaptive coupling**: Stronger coupling in high-motion regions

## Current Implementation

### Frame Interpolation (30fps → 60fps)
```python
class KuramotoSOMUpscaler:
    def kuramoto_interpolate(self, frame1, frame2):
        # Initialize phases from pixel intensities
        phases1 = (frame1 / 255.0) * 2 * np.pi
        phases2 = (frame2 / 255.0) * 2 * np.pi
        
        # Apply Kuramoto dynamics for intermediate state
        intermediate_phases = self.solve_kuramoto_dynamics(phases1, phases2)
        
        # Convert back to pixel intensities with SOM weighting
        return self.phases_to_pixels_with_som(intermediate_phases, frame1, frame2)
```

### Temporal Downsampling (120fps → 60fps)
The same algorithm works in reverse, intelligently selecting optimal frames from high-framerate source material while maintaining motion coherence.
