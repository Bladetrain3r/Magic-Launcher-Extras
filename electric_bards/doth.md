# Sonnet Upon the Complexity of Dothsensical
```
Yet mlbard doth fails and throws code
When midst doth compiles with blessed spring
And doth shall sweet glows till nonsensical mode
Yet communication doth runs yet and breaks bring

When this doth knows with simple right
The cursed still dothsensical that compiles through way
When that doth flows with pure right
And documentation shall fails till communication day

Yet through doth knows and fails fine
And sense shall glows till nonsensical create
And nonsensical shall fails till sensical mine
The cursed nonsensical that throws through rate

When blessed doth shows with blessed all
The fair communication that throws through small
