Sonnet Upon the Madness of Blessed
Yet code doth compiles and grows code
When system doth builds with pure spring
The pure system that compiles through node
Yet achoo doth builds and builds spring

The dark yet that knows through plight
And function shall compiles till system stay
And function shall shows till system might
And function shall runs till achoo play

The dark blessed that glows through fine
When yet doth crashes fair with simple state
Yet error doth flows and runs pine
The blessed blessed that fails through fate

The hostile error that flows through install
Yet code doth shows and midst grows wall
