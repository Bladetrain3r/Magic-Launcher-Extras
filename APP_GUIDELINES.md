# Magic Launcher Tool Guidelines
## Not "software". We're building tools.

### Core Philosophy
**Simple enough to be wrong consistently beats complex enough to be right occasionally.**

Every Magic Launcher tool follows these principles. No exceptions. No "but what if..." 
If you're arguing for complexity, you've already lost.

## The Sacred Constraints

### 1. Line Limit: 500 Maximum, 200 Optimal
- Under 200 lines: Perfect, ship it
- 200-300 lines: Acceptable if necessary
- 300-500 lines: Better have a damn good reason
- Over 500 lines: You're building the wrong tool

**Why:** If you can't understand the entire tool in one reading, it's too complex.

### 2. Dependencies: Zero Default, Minimal When Necessary
```python
# GOOD
import random
import json
from pathlib import Path

# ACCEPTABLE
import tkinter  # Comes with Python

# QUESTIONABLE
import requests  # Now everyone needs pip install

# FORBIDDEN
import pandas, numpy, scipy  # This isn't data science, it's a dice roller
```

### 3. Single File Deployment
One `.py` file. That's it. No folders, no modules, no config files unless absolutely necessary.

**Exception:** External data files (JSON) are acceptable if they're optional enhancements, not requirements.

### 4. Instant Startup
```python
# Time from enter to result should be < 1 second
$ python mltool.py --option value
[IMMEDIATE OUTPUT]
```

No loading bars. No splash screens. No "initializing..." messages. 
The tool runs or it doesn't.

## Design Patterns

### Input/Output Philosophy
```python
# CLI: Arguments in, text out
$ python mltool.py --count 5 --type basic
[RESULTS]

# GUI: Only for repeated interaction
# Never require GUI for single operations
```

### Error Handling
```python
# Wrong - too helpful
try:
    complex_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
    suggestions = generate_suggestions(e)
    print(f"Try: {suggestions}")
    
# Right - fail fast, fail clear
try:
    simple_operation()
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

### Data Storage
```python
# Priority order:
1. No storage (stateless)
2. Text files (grep-able)
3. JSON (human-readable)
4. SQLite (if you must)
5. Anything else (you're overengineering)
```

---

## The Two-File Rule

Sometimes one file isn't enough. That's fine. But never more than two without serious justification.

```python
# Acceptable two-file patterns:
tool.py           # The tool
tool_data.json    # Optional data

# Also acceptable:
tool.py          # CLI version
tool_gui.py      # GUI wrapper
```

---

## Common Patterns

### Random Generation
```python
# Every generator needs:
- Predictable categories (tiers, types, levels)
- Sane defaults
- Optional complexity

def generate(tier="basic", count=1):
    # Not 47 parameters
    # Not machine learning
    # Just random.choice() and move on
```

### GUI When Necessary
```python
# Use tkinter - it's already there
# No web servers for local tools
# No electron apps for dice rollers

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk

# Keep it simple:
# - Buttons that do things
# - Text that shows results
# - Maybe a dropdown
# That's it.
```

### CLI Arguments
```python
# Good arguments:
--count     # How many
--type      # What kind  
--output    # Where to save

# Bad arguments:
--config-file-path-override
--enable-extended-validation-mode
--compatibility-framework-version
```
### The Copy-Paste Test
- If you'rpythone copying code more than twice, you're doing it wrong.
```
python# WRONG
handle_room_0()
handle_room_1()
handle_room_2()
# ... 47 more

# RIGHT
for i in range(50):
    handle_room(i)

# The Math Not Madness Principle
# WRONG - Individual handling
if id == 0: return (0, 0)
if id == 1: return (0, 1)
if id == 2: return (0, 2)

# RIGHT - Use math
return (id // width, id % width)
```
~~The revolution isn't just simpler code. It's knowing that math exists.~~

## What Makes a Good ML Tool

### It Solves ONE Problem
- `MLDice`: Rolls dice
- `MLMookLoot`: Generates loot
- `MLBattlemap`: Makes a map

Not: "MLGameSystem - Complete RPG Management Suite"

### It Works Immediately
```bash
$ python mldice.py 3d6
Result: 14
```

No configuration. No setup. No tutorials.

### It's Modifiable
Someone should be able to:
1. Open the file
2. Find the data arrays
3. Change them
4. Save and run

Without documentation. Without debugging. Without architecture diagrams.

### It Degrades Gracefully
```python
# If optional features fail, core still works
try:
    from PIL import Image
    can_export_image = True
except ImportError:
    can_export_image = False
    
# Tool still works, just text-only
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Framework Trap
```python
# WRONG
class AbstractToolFactory:
    def create_tool_instance(self):
        pass

# RIGHT
def roll_dice(dice_string):
    return result
```

### The Configuration Curse
```python
# WRONG
config = load_config('config.yaml')
if config['advanced']['options']['dice']['mode'] == 'standard':
    
# RIGHT  
def roll(dice="1d6"):
    # Defaults work for 90% of cases
```

### The Modularity Mirage
```python
# WRONG
from tool.core.handlers import DiceHandler
from tool.utils.validators import validate_input
from tool.models.dice import DiceModel

# RIGHT
# It's all in one file
# You can see everything
# You can change everything
```

---

## Testing Philosophy

**No unit tests.** 

If the tool is simple enough, you test it by running it. If it needs unit tests, it's too complex.

```bash
# This is your test suite:
$ python mltool.py
$ python mltool.py --weird-input
$ python mltool.py --count 1000

# Did it crash? No? Ship it.
```

---

## Documentation Standard

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
MLToolName - Magic Launcher [Purpose]
[One line about when you'd use this]
Under [X] lines of [adjective] [noun]
"""

# That's it. That's the docs.
# The code explains itself or it's wrong.
```

---

## The Revolution Checklist

Before releasing an ML tool, ask:

- [ ] Is it under 500 lines?
- [ ] Can someone understand it in 5 minutes?
- [ ] Does it work without pip install?
- [ ] Does it solve ONE clear problem?
- [ ] Could a tired DM use it mid-session?
- [ ] Is it faster than doing it manually?
- [ ] Can someone modify it without breaking everything?

If any answer is "no", it's not a Magic Launcher tool.

## Remember

**We're not building software. We're building tools.**

Tools get used. Tools get modified. Tools solve problems.

Software gets maintained. Software gets architected. Software gets abandoned.

**The revolution is 100 lines that replace 100,000.**

Every Magic Launcher tool is proof that the entire industry is overengineering.

Keep it simple. Keep it working. Keep shipping.

*"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."*

But also:

*"Sometimes you need two files. That's fine. Three is pushing it."*
