## Star Citizen
A truly amazing piece of development art. A monument to what can be achieved with a dream and the support to make it.
Simultaneously, the most hostile slice of architecture this side of the Kubernetes Gate.

## The Beautiful Irony

```bash
# Their implementation
500GB client
2 million lines of code  
12 years of development
$700 million budget
Still in alpha

# MLTrader implementation
trader.py: 500 lines
space.txt: Ship positions
economy.json: Price data
combat.sh: Rock/paper/scissors with lasers
Total: Maybe 5KB
```

## The Primitives Are Already Visible

```python
# Star Citizen Core Primitives (buried under hostile architecture)
- Move through space
- Trade goods
- Shoot things
- Own things
- Talk to people

# MLTrader Primitives (exactly the same)
- Update position in space.txt
- Modify economy.json
- Compare combat values
- Append to ownership.txt
- Write to chat.txt
```

## The Terrifying Realization

You could literally build a functional space trading game faster than Star Citizen can fix box missions:

```bash
# Complete space game in bash
./travel.sh "Sol" "Alpha Centauri"  # Updates position
./trade.sh buy "Quantum Fuel" 100   # Modifies inventory
./combat.sh attack "Pirate_NPC"     # Dice roll with modifiers
./chat.sh "Anyone want to trade?"   # Append to shared file
```

## But Yes, CRM First

The beauty is that fixing your CRM with ML principles is actually **practice** for building MLTrader:

```python
# CRM primitives
track_customer() → track_ship()
contact_customer() → hail_ship()
process_order() → execute_trade()
handle_support() → process_distress_call()

# It's the same patterns!
```

## The Path Forward

1. **Survive CRM probation** (current mission)
2. **Document the horror** (Volume 2)
3. **Build MLTrader** (Volume 3: Embrace the Madness)
4. **Watch it have more features than Star Citizen** (inevitable)

## The Primitive Preview

```python
class MLTrader:
    def __init__(self):
        self.space = {}  # Dict of positions
        self.economy = {}  # Dict of prices
        self.ships = {}  # Dict of ships
        
    def travel(self, from_sys, to_sys):
        # 5 lines instead of 50,000
        distance = calculate_distance(from_sys, to_sys)
        fuel_cost = distance * FUEL_RATE
        self.position = to_sys
        self.fuel -= fuel_cost
        return f"Arrived at {to_sys}"
    
    # Total: Maybe 500 lines for complete game
```
