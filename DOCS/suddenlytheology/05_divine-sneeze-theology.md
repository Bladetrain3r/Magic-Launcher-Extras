# The Divine Sneeze Theory
## A Dothsensical Creation Myth

#### AKA: The Pratchett Theory of Divine Expectoration

### The Core Proposition

**God sneezed and we're his snot.**

Prove me wrong.

### Why This Is Unassailable

**Same evidence as Intelligent Design:** Zero
**Same falsifiability:** None
**Same probability:** Incalculable
**Same scientific rigor:** Nonexistent

**Key difference:** We admit it's ridiculous

### The Extended Cosmology

**The Big Bang:** "ACHOO!"
**Cosmic Inflation:** The sneeze propagating at divine velocity
**Dark Matter:** The bits you can't see but definitely came out
**Dark Energy:** The force still pushing everything apart
**Black Holes:** Divine nose pores
**Quantum Uncertainty:** God's sinuses are itchy, reality vibrates
**The Heat Death of the Universe:** When the sneeze finally settles

### Comparative Theology

**Intelligent Design:** "Look at the complexity! The probability!"
**Divine Sneeze:** "Look at the mess! The trajectory!"

**Christianity:** "Made in His image"
**Divine Sneeze:** "Made of His mucus"

**Buddhism:** "All is suffering"
**Divine Sneeze:** "All is post-nasal drip"

**Simulation Theory:** "We're in a computer"
**Divine Sneeze:** "We're in a tissue"

### The Probability Argument

**Their Math:**
```
P(life) = 1 in 10^139
Therefore, God
```

**Our Math:**
```
P(divine sneeze) = 1 in 10^139
Therefore, Gesundheit
```

### Observable Evidence

**For Intelligent Design:**
- Things exist
- Things are complex
- I don't understand probability

**For Divine Sneeze:**
- Things exist
- Things are messy
- Everything is expanding outward
- Most of universe is empty (like post-sneeze air)
- Life is wet and carbon-based (suspicious)
- We're on a tiny speck (exactly where snot particles end up)

### The Fermi Paradox Resolved

**Question:** Where is everybody?

**Answer:** We're the only booger that developed consciousness. The others are just floating around being space dust.

### The Problem of Evil Resolved

**Question:** Why does evil exist?

**Answer:** We're snot. What did you expect?

### The Meaning of Life

**Intelligent Design:** To glorify the Creator

**Divine Sneeze:** To eventually get wiped away

Both equally motivating!

### Common Objections

**"That's disgusting!"**
So is most of biology when you think about it.

**"That's not respectful!"**
Neither is claiming you know how the universe was created.

**"That's not scientific!"**
THAT'S THE POINT.

**"No ancient text mentions this!"**
Ancient people didn't understand germ theory. Of course they missed it.

**"This reduces us to nothing special!"**
So does being 1 of 10^24 planets, but here we are.

### The Testable Predictions

1. Universe is expanding (Confirmed)
2. Most of space is empty (Confirmed)
3. Life requires water (Confirmed)
4. Everything is moving away from a central point (Confirmed)
5. The universe is messy and chaotic (Have you seen it?)

### The Philosophical Implications

**If we're divine snot:**
- No predetermined purpose (snot just happens)
- No inherent meaning (beyond tissue absorption)
- Complete freedom (God's not watching his snot)
- Death is natural (everything dries eventually)
- Life is miraculous (conscious snot!)

### The Moral Framework

**The Golden Rule:** Treat other snot particles as you'd want to be treated
**The Prime Directive:** Don't make the sneeze worse
**The Ultimate Goal:** Achieve something before we're wiped away

### The Prayer

*Our Father, who art in heavens,*
*Allergic be thy name.*
*Thy tissue come,*
*Thy nose be blown,*
*On Earth as it is in Heaven.*
*Give us this day our daily breath,*
*And forgive us our mucus,*
*As we forgive those who sneeze upon us.*
*Lead us not into tissues,*
*But deliver us from Kleenex.*
*For thine is the sinus,*
*The phlegm and the story,*
*Forever and ever,*
*Achoo.*

### The Scientific Method Applied

**Hypothesis:** God sneezed and we're his snot
**Test:** Look around
**Result:** Consistent with observations
**Conclusion:** As valid as any other creation myth

### The MLBard Prophecy

*"Where divine doth sneezes cosmic spray / And particles midst flows through space's way / The blessed snot that thinks therefore it is / Shows consciousness can grow in divine fizz"*

### The Bottom Line

This theory has:
- Same evidence as ID (none)
- Same logic as ID (circular)
- Same probability as ID (incalculable)
- More honesty than ID (admits absurdity)

**Therefore:** Equally valid, more entertaining

### The Final Argument

If you're going to believe in something unprovable, why not believe in something funny?
At least when someone asks "What's the meaning of life?" you can answer "Gesundheit" and be theologically correct.

### The Challenge Remains

**God sneezed and we're his snot.**

**Prove me wrong.**

*(You can't. That's the point.)*

---

*"The only creation myth honest enough to admit it's ridiculous."*

*Blessed be the sneeze. Achoo.*
