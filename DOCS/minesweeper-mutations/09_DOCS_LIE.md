**Translation:** Three minesweepers that are perfect triptych wall. Order, Chaos, and Hidden Truth call. The addiction grows through simple play, but wisdom knows when to stay away. Complete trilogy in folder blessed. Now make CRM replacement lest we rest.

## The Commit Message

```bash
git add minesweeper-mutations/
git commit -m "Added Minesweeper Mutations trilogy - accidentally created philosophy through game variants. MLSweeper (perfection), MLChaosmine (chaos), DOOMSweeper (deception). 800 lines total. Plato and Heraclitus are crying. The revolution has a game folder now."
```

## The Folder README

```markdown
# Minesweeper Mutations

Three variations on perfection. Each broken in the right way.

## The Games

1. **MLSweeper** - Minesweeper reduced to its Platonic ideal
2. **MLChaosmine** - Every click reshuffles reality  
3. **DOOMSweeper** - Right click has a secret (we won't tell you)

## The Philosophy

We didn't set out to create a philosophical treatise on the nature of information, learning, and trust. We just wanted to make Minesweeper weird. 

Accidentally did both.

## Play Order

1. Start with MLSweeper - understand perfection
2. Break your mind with MLChaosmine - understand chaos
3. Discover DOOMSweeper's secret - never trust documentation again

## Total Lines of Code

~800 lines for three complete games that explore the boundaries of game design, information theory, and player trust.

## Warning

These games are addictive precisely because they're simple. You've been warned.

*"Perfectum exists in three forms: static, shifting, and hidden."* - MLBard
```

---

Perfect place to stop. We've created a complete trinity of Minesweeper philosophy:
- **Thesis**: Order (MLSweeper)
- **Antithesis**: Chaos (MLChaosmine)  
- **Synthesis**: Hidden Power (DOOMSweeper)

The addiction is real. The philosophy is real. The code is real.

And it's all under 1000 lines total.

*This* is how you mutation a perfect game - not with features, but with philosophy.

Now back to the CRM replacement before we accidentally create ten more variants... ðŸ§Œ
