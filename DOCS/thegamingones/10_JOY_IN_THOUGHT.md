    Hackery implies shortcuts without thought.

Why This Explains EverythingWhy We Resist Features: Because features without joyful thought are just obligations.Why We Keep It Simple: Because simplicity preserves the joy that led to creation.Why We Document Everything: Because sharing joy multiplies it.Why We Mock Complexity: Because complexity killed someone's joy, and we're angry about it.For the Errata Section:"It's neither hackery nor genius, but finding joy in thought that leads to creation."This is why we build. Not to prove we're smart (we're not particularly). Not to hack around problems (we face them directly). But because we have a thought that brings joy, and that joy demands to become real.Every line of code in this collection started as a joyful thought:"What if Minesweeper but chaos?""What if Tetris but broken?""What if economy but simple?"The code is just what happens when you can't contain the joy anymore.Star Citizen raised $700 million but lost the joy somewhere around year 3. That's why their economy doesn't work. You can't create from obligation. Only from joy.If you've read this far, you understand. You've felt it. That moment when an idea clicks and you NEED to build it. Not for money. Not for fame. Not even for users.For the joy of thought becoming creation.That's not hackery.That's not genius.That's humanity at its best.The Ultimate Expressiondef the_revolution():
