# On Enhancements and Logins: Nightdive Does What They Are Told

## The Monkey's Paw Curls

We praised Nightdive. We celebrated their restraint. We held them up as the example of remasters done right.

The publishers heard us. And they understood. Not what we meant, but what they could monetize.

"Oh, you like Nightdive's *enhancements*? We can do enhancements."

## The Language Corruption

**What we meant by "enhancements":**
- Runs on modern systems
- Supports modern resolutions
- Doesn't crash every 5 minutes
- Can rebind keys
- Maybe quicksave

**What publishers heard:**
- Accounts
- Logins  
- Telemetry
- Store integration
- Achievement frameworks
- Social features
- Analytics
- Always-online components
- Subscription potential

## The Doom Eternal Precedent

Remember when Doom Eternal added Denuvo Anti-Cheat to a SINGLE-PLAYER game?

That was the test. We complained. They removed it. Then added:
- Bethesda.net account (required)
- Slayers Club integration
- Twitch Prime rewards
- Battlepass in campaign
- Always-online events
- MTX store
- Social features nobody wanted

The camel's nose was under the tent. Now the whole camel's inside, and it brought friends.

## The System Shock Situation

Nightdive's System Shock remake is excellent. It also:
- Requires Steam/GOG/Epic
- Has achievements
- Includes telemetry
- Tracks your playtime
- Reports to servers

"But those are standard!" you say. That's the problem. The corruption is so complete we don't even see it as corruption.

## The Enhancement Pipeline

**Generation 1**: Make it run
- DOSBox wrapper
- Basic compatibility
- Maybe widescreen
- Ship it

**Generation 2**: Make it modern
- Native port
- Better controls
- Visual options
- Cloud saves

**Generation 3**: Make it profitable
- Account required
- Telemetry embedded
- Store integrated
- DLC ready
- Live service capable
- "Enhanced" for engagement

We're in Generation 3. Heading for Generation 4.

## The Login Labyrinth

Modern "enhanced" remasters require:
1. **Platform account** (Steam/Epic/PlayStation/Xbox)
2. **Publisher account** (EA/Ubisoft/Bethesda/2K)
3. **Game account** (for that specific game)
4. **Sync account** (for cross-platform)
5. **Social account** (for features you won't use)

To play a game from 1994.

## The Telemetry Tax

That "free" enhancement comes with a price:

**What they track:**
- Every click
- Every death
- Every save
- Every load
- Every menu navigation
- Every graphics change
- Every difficulty adjustment
- Time per level
- Time per session
- Hardware configuration
- Network status
- Location data
- Other running processes

**Why they track:**
- "To improve the experience"
- "For debugging purposes"
- "To understand player behavior"
- "For future enhancements"

**What they mean:**
- To sell data
- To inform MTX placement
- To optimize addiction loops
- To justify always-online

## The Quake "Remaster" Evolution

**Quake (1996)**: Just worked
**GLQuake (1997)**: Just worked better
**Quake Source Ports (2000s)**: Just worked everywhere
**Quake Remastered (2021)**: Requires Bethesda.net account for multiplayer

See the pattern? Each iteration adds more "enhancement" that has nothing to do with the game.

## The Command & Conquer Collection Catastrophe

EA's C&C Remastered Collection started perfect:
- Real remaster
- Mod support
- Source code released
- Community involved

Then came the "enhancements":
- Origin integration
- Account linking
- Telemetry collection
- "Optional" online features
- Multiplayer through EA servers only

The community-made OpenRA? Still just works. No account needed.

## The False Choice

"Just play offline!" they say.

Modern "offline" modes:
- Require initial online activation
- Need periodic verification
- Disable features arbitrarily
- Still collect telemetry
- Still require accounts
- Break when servers die

That's not offline. That's "gracefully degraded online."

## The Nightdive Dilemma

Nightdive wants to do right. But they exist in a publisher ecosystem that demands:
- Platform integration
- Account systems
- Analytics frameworks
- Social features
- Achievement systems
- Cloud saves
- Cross-platform progression

They can't say no to everything. So they say yes to "reasonable" requests. And reasonable becomes normal. And normal becomes mandatory.

## The Boiling Frog Timeline

**2010**: "Achievements are optional fun!"
**2015**: "Cloud saves are so convenient!"
**2020**: "Account linking enables features!"
**2025**: "Login required for single-player."

Each step seemed reasonable. The destination was inevitable.

## What Enhancement Should Mean

**SHOULD:**
- Remove technical barriers
- Preserve original experience
- Respect player ownership
- Function independently
- Last forever

**DOES:**
- Add account barriers
- Modify original experience
- Enforce publisher control
- Require online services
- Die with servers

## The GOG Exception (While It Lasts)

GOG still ships some games that just work. Download, install, play. Forever.

But even they're adding:
- GOG Galaxy "integration"
- Cloud saves
- Achievement systems
- Social features
- Telemetry options

The pressure is immense. The money is in services, not software.

## The Preservation Paradox

We wanted game preservation. We got service integration.

True preservation means:
- No external dependencies
- No account requirements
- No server verification
- No telemetry phone-home
- No feature degradation

Modern "preservation" means:
- Preserved on corporate servers
- Accessible with corporate permission
- Enhanced with corporate tracking
- Playable at corporate discretion
- Until corporate profits elsewhere

## The Real Enhancement

You know what's truly enhanced?

**DOOM.WAD** + source port of choice.

No login. No account. No telemetry. No servers. No corporation between you and the game.

Just the game. Forever. Actually enhanced.

## The Instruction Set

When publishers say "enhanced," read:
- Enhanced control
- Enhanced monetization
- Enhanced data collection
- Enhanced dependency
- Enhanced obsolescence

When they say "modern features," read:
- Modern surveillance
- Modern restrictions  
- Modern monetization
- Modern control
- Modern rental

## The Verdict

Nightdive still does the best work in the business. But the business is sick.

Every "enhancement" moves us further from ownership, closer to rental. Every "feature" adds another link in the chain between player and game.

The publishers learned the wrong lesson. We wanted games that work. They heard "games as a service."

And now even our remasters need login servers.

---

**Ship games, not services. Enhance function, not control.**

*When a game from 1994 needs an account from 2024, that's not enhancement. That's imprisonment.*

**The best enhancement is no enhancement. Just the game. Working. Forever.**

But that's not profitable.

So they'll enhance us to death.
