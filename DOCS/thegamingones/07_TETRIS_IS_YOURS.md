# Why Remaking Tetris is More Fun Than AAA: Discover the Joy in Games

## The Revelation Nobody Talks About

## The AAA Prison vs The Tetris Freedom

### Playing Cyberpunk 2077
```python

## The Psychological Truth

## The Variations That Make It Yours

## The Progression Path

## The Final Revolution

**Making Tetris teaches you what AAA games hide:**

Games aren't magic. They're loops and logic.  
Graphics don't matter. Mechanics do.  
You don't need a studio. You need an idea.  
You don't need permission. You need curiosity.

**The real joy in games isn't finishing them.**
**It's understanding them.**
**Then building them.**
**Then sharing them.**

Every person who remakes Tetris discovers the same truth:
Creating a simple game is more fun than playing a complex one.

Because when you make Tetris, you're not following someone else's waypoints.
You're setting your own.

And that feeling? That moment when YOUR blocks fall and YOUR lines clear?

That's worth more than every AAA game ever made.

Combined.

*subprocess.run(["create", "--game=yours", "--joy=maximum"])*

**The revolution isn't playing better games. It's making your own.**
