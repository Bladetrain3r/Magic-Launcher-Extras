# IP Clutching and License Woes: Why Nobody Can Found Another Valve

## The Gravity Well

Valve created Steam in 2003 when digital distribution was a joke and publishers thought it was a fad. They built their monopoly in a legal vacuum.

That vacuum is now filled with lawyers.

## The Impossible Dream

Every few years, someone announces they'll "compete with Steam":
- Epic Games Store (2018)
- Discord Store (2018-2019, RIP)
- Origin (2011)
- Uplay/Ubisoft Connect (2012)
- GOG Galaxy (2014)
- Microsoft Store (Forever failing)

They all learn the same lesson: You can't recreate 2003 in 2025.

## The IP Physics Problem

When Valve started, publishers didn't understand digital. Contracts were simple:
- "You want to sell our game online?"
- "Sure, here's a standard retail agreement"
- "70/30 split?"
- "Whatever, it'll never amount to anything"

Now? Every publisher has:
- Digital distribution agreements (47 pages)
- Platform exclusivity clauses
- Revenue share negotiations
- Feature requirement lists
- DRM implementation demands
- Data ownership disputes
- Regional licensing complexity
- Competing platform restrictions

One game, seventeen lawyers.

## The Bootstrap Paradox

To compete with Steam, you need:
- Massive game library
- Established user base
- Developer tools
- Payment processing
- Content delivery network
- Community features
- Workshop/modding support
- Cloud saves
- Achievement systems
- Anti-cheat integration
- VR support
- Linux compatibility
- Controller support
- Streaming features
- Social systems

To get games, you need users. To get users, you need games.

Steam had 20 years to build this. You have investor patience measured in quarters.

## The Exclusive Hostage Strategy

Epic's "solution": Buy exclusives.

Result:
- Spent billions
- Bought hatred
- Still losing money
- Created precedent for bidding wars
- Made PC gaming worse

They proved you can't buy your way to Steam's position. You can only burn money trying.

## The Legal Labyrinth

Start a new platform today, face:

### Publisher Demands
- Guaranteed minimum sales
- Marketing commitments  
- Feature parity with Steam
- Better revenue split
- Exclusivity payments
- Regional compliance
- Tax handling
- Refund policies matching Steam
- Review system moderation
- DMCA compliance

### Developer Expectations
- Free keys for external sales
- Steamworks API compatibility
- Workshop equivalent
- Cloud save system
- Achievement framework
- Multiplayer infrastructure
- Anti-cheat support
- VR integration
- Controller remapping
- Beta branch support

### Legal Requirements
- GDPR compliance (Europe)
- COPPA compliance (children)
- Regional rating systems
- Gambling legislation (loot boxes)
- Tax collection (every jurisdiction)
- Content moderation laws
- Export restrictions
- Sanctions compliance
- Money transmission licenses
- Consumer protection laws

## The Network Effect Noose

Steam's real moat isn't technology. It's:

**300 million users with:**
- Thousands of games in libraries
- Decades of achievements
- Friends lists built over years
- Workshop subscriptions
- Community guides written
- Screenshots uploaded
- Reviews written
- Curator lists followed
- Trading cards collected
- Inventories worth money

You're not asking them to try a new store. You're asking them to abandon their digital life.

## The Steamworks Trap

Steamworks is free. It's also a prison.

Games integrated with Steamworks need:
- Steam for multiplayer
- Steam for saves
- Steam for achievements
- Steam for DRM
- Steam for updates
- Steam for mods
- Steam for everything

"Just build compatibility!" Sure. Reverse-engineer a proprietary API while Valve's lawyers sharpen their knives. What could go wrong?

## The Infrastructure Investment

Conservative estimates for Steam-level infrastructure:
- **CDN**: $50M/year minimum
- **Bandwidth**: Petabytes daily
- **Storage**: Exabytes total
- **Support**: Thousands of tickets daily
- **Localization**: 29 languages
- **Payment**: 200+ methods
- **Servers**: Global presence
- **Security**: Constant attacks
- **Legal**: Every country's laws
- **Development**: Hundreds of engineers

That's before you sell a single game.

## The Publisher Prisoner's Dilemma

Publishers know Steam's 30% cut is high. But:

**Option 1**: Stay on Steam
- Pay 30%
- Access 300M users
- Proven infrastructure
- Established workflows

**Option 2**: Go exclusive elsewhere
- Better revenue split
- Anger customers
- Lose sales
- Fragment player base

**Option 3**: Launch everywhere
- Multiply development costs
- Support nightmare
- Confused customers
- Diluted marketing

They choose Option 1. Every time.

## The Time Machine Problem

Valve succeeded because:
- First mover advantage (2003)
- No competition for years
- Publishers didn't understand digital
- No established expectations
- Could grow organically
- Built habits over decades

Starting now means:
- Competing with perfected platform
- Publishers who know the value
- Users with established libraries
- Expectations of feature parity
- Need everything day one
- Fighting decades of habit

## The Open Source Mirage

"Just make it open source!"

Cool. Who pays for:
- Petabytes of bandwidth
- Global CDN infrastructure
- Content moderation
- Legal compliance
- Payment processing
- Customer support
- Anti-fraud systems
- Security team
- DMCA handling
- Tax compliance

Open source the code. Can't open source the costs.

## The Real Competition

The only entities that could compete with Steam:

**Microsoft**: Has infrastructure, fumbles execution
**Sony**: Has games, hates PC
**Amazon**: Has AWS, can't make games
**Google**: Has everything, killed Stadia anyway
**Apple**: Has money, doesn't care

They all have the resources. None have the will. Or competence.

## The Regulatory Capture

Wait for governments to break up Steam?

Regulators don't understand:
- Digital distribution
- Game licensing  
- Platform economics
- Network effects
- International complexity

By the time they act, we'll be arguing about VR monopolies while playing on Steam Neural Interface.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Steam is a natural monopoly. Like water pipes or power lines, some infrastructure tends toward single providers.

The difference? We can regulate utilities. We can't regulate international digital distribution without breaking the internet.

## The Prisoner's Paradise

We're all prisoners in Steam. But it's a nice prison:
- Sales are good
- Features work
- Library is safe
- Gabe hasn't gone evil
- Yet

The moment Steam gets sold to Microsoft/Amazon/Tencent, we're fucked. But until then, we pretend the monopoly is benevolent.

## The Conclusion

You can't found another Valve because:

1. **Legal environment changed**: Every agreement is a battlefield
2. **Expectations calcified**: Users demand 20 years of features
3. **Network effects compound**: Each year makes it harder
4. **Infrastructure costs explode**: Billions just to start
5. **Publishers learned**: They know what they're worth
6. **Patents exist**: Good luck implementing cart functionality
7. **Regulations multiply**: Compliance is a full-time job
8. **Time moved forward**: 2003 is gone forever

The window closed. It's not closing - it's closed. Welded shut. Painted over.

## The Epitaph

Steam won by being first, being patient, and being there when everyone realized digital was the future.

Everyone else loses by being late, being rushed, and being forced to compete with two decades of entrenchment.

You can't found another Valve. You can only hope Valve doesn't turn evil.

**First mover advantage in digital distribution isn't an advantage. It's destiny.**

*The next Valve isn't being built. It already was built. Twenty years ago. When nobody was paying attention.*

**Now everyone's paying attention. That's why it's impossible.**
