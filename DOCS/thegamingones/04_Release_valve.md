# Building Pressure Part 2: When the Only Way Forward is Parasitism or Niche Prayers

## The Ecosystem Diagnosis

Every mature tech ecosystem reaches the same endpoint: a few apex predators and everything else either feeds on them or hides in the cracks.

We're there. The consolidation is complete. Now comes the interesting part: evolution under pressure.

## The Parasite Portfolio

When you can't be a predator, become a remora. Let's examine the modern tech parasitism playbook:

### Type 1: The Compatibility Layer

**Examples**: Wine, Proton, CrossOver

**Strategy**: Don't compete with Windows. Make Windows irrelevant.

**Brilliance**: Microsoft can't sue compatibility. They tried. They lost.

### Type 2: The Enhancement Parasite

**Examples**: BetterDiscord, Reddit Enhancement Suite, uBlock

**Strategy**: Make the host tolerable enough that users don't leave

**Irony**: Often keeping the host alive longer than it deserves

### Type 3: The API Lamprey

**Examples**: Third-party Reddit apps (RIP), Twitter clients (RIP), Instagram viewers

**Strategy**: Provide the experience the host refuses to

**Fate**: Usually murdered when host gets greedy

### Type 4: The Infrastructure Remora

**Examples**: CDNs, payment processors, authentication services

**Strategy**: Handle the painful parts hosts don't want

**Success rate**: High until host decides to bring it in-house

## The Archive Remora Model

Your Steam Archive idea is a new variant:

**The Pitch**: "We're your overflow parking lot"
- We store what you don't want to
- We serve what's not profitable
- We preserve what you'd delete
- We're not competition, we're compression

**The Hook**: Storage costs always increase. Revenue per old game always decreases.

**The Evolution**: When Steam enshittifies, you're not scrambling to build infrastructure. You already have it. You just change the front door.

## The Niche Prayer Pantheon

If parasitism feels dirty, there's always the niche. Pray to these gods:

### The God of Specific Needs

**Itch.io**: Indie games for people who hate corporations

**Success**: Profitable, sustainable, beloved

**Limitation**: Niche by definition

### The God of Regional Monopoly

**WeGame** (China), **Game Jolt** (dead), **Kartridge** (who?)

**Strategy**: Dominate where Steam can't/won't

**Problem**: Steam goes everywhere eventually

### The God of Ideological Purity

**GOG**: DRM-free or die

**Status**: Perpetually almost profitable

**Truth**: Ideology doesn't scale

### The God of Technical Superiority

**Every launcher promising "better performance"**

**Reality**: Nobody cares if Steam works good enough

**Lesson**: Technical superiority is not a business model

## The Pressure Dynamics

Why only parasitism and prayers remain:

### The Capital Singularity
- Starting capital required: Billions
- Expected ROI: Negative for decades
- Investor patience: Quarters
- Math: Doesn't

### The Legal Calcification
- Every agreement: Weaponized
- Every feature: Patented
- Every process: Regulated
- Every innovation: Litigated

### The Network Neutron Star
- User gravity: Infinite
- Escape velocity: Impossible
- New platforms: Crushed to atoms
- Only option: Orbit

### The Expectation Inflation
- 2003: "It downloads games!"
- 2013: "It has sales!"
- 2023: "Full feature parity or death"
- 2033: "Neural integration when?"

## The Successful Parasites

Let's study what works:

### Humble Bundle
- Started: Charity game bundles
- Became: Steam key reseller
- Bought by: IGN
- Status: Still exists somehow

**Lesson**: Parasites can be acquired, not killed

### Green Man Gaming
- Model: Sell Steam keys cheaper
- Innovation: None needed
- Profitability: Apparently yes
- Future: Until publishers say no

**Lesson**: Arbitrage is parasitism with a business degree

### Epic Games Store
- Strategy: Burn money for market share
- Result: Burned money, no market share
- Status: Expensive parasite
- Future: Fortnite subsidizes forever

**Lesson**: Even billions can't buy evolution

## The Prayer Success Stories

### Itch.io: The Cockroach
- Survives everything
- Needs almost nothing
- Fills specific niche perfectly
- Will outlive us all

### Battle.net: The Captive Audience
- Only sells Blizzard games
- Doesn't need to compete
- Prints money
- Until Blizzard doesn't

### Game Pass: The Category Error
- Not competing with Steam
- Competing with Netflix
- Different physics entirely
- Microsoft subsidizes forever

## The Uncomfortable Strategy Guide

### If You're Going Parasite:

1. **Pick your host carefully**
   - Too weak: Dies, taking you with it
   - Too strong: Might notice and scratch

2. **Provide genuine value**
   - Parasites that weaken hosts die with them
   - Symbiosis is sustainable parasitism

3. **Have an exit strategy**
   - Hosts die
   - Hosts turn hostile
   - Hosts get acquired by Oracle

4. **Stay small enough to ignore**
   - Big parasites get antibodies
   - Small parasites get tolerance

### If You're Going Niche:

1. **Define your niche precisely**
   - "Gamers" is not a niche
   - "Speed runners who need frame-perfect input" is

2. **Own it completely**
   - Better to have 100% of 1% than 0% of 100%

3. **Accept the ceiling**
   - Niches don't become mainstreams
   - Mainstreams eat niches

4. **Build community, not customers**
   - Communities survive platforms
   - Customers follow features

## The Future Ecology

By 2030:
- **Steam**: Still dominant, slightly more evil
- **Epic**: Still burning money, accepted as permanent loss leader
- **GOG**: Still almost profitable
- **Microsoft**: Still fumbling despite infinite resources
- **Parasites**: Thriving in the gaps
- **Niches**: Happy in their corners

## The Real Innovation

The next big thing won't be a Steam competitor. It'll be something that makes Steam irrelevant. Like Steam made retail irrelevant.

Maybe:
- Streaming makes downloads obsolete
- VR needs different distribution
- AI generates games on demand
- Regulation forces unbundling
- Climate change ends gaming (dark but possible)

Until then? Parasitism and prayers.

## The Wisdom

You can't replant a forest that's already climax ecology. You can:
- Be a vine that climbs the trees
- Be a mushroom in the shadows
- Be a bird that nests in branches
- Wait for fire to clear the canopy

But you can't be another tree. Those positions are taken.

## The Conclusion

The tech ecosystem has calcified into feudalism. You're either:
- A lord (Platform owner)
- A vassal (Approved partner)
- A parasite (Tolerated opportunist)
- A hermit (Niche prayer warrior)
- A corpse (Direct competitor)

Choose wisely. Or better yet, find the thing that makes the choice irrelevant.

**Evolution doesn't mean getting bigger. Sometimes it means getting smaller and finding a niche where the giants can't reach.**

*The next Valve isn't competing with Steam. It's making Steam as irrelevant as Blockbuster.*

**Until then, sharpen your mandibles or practice your prayers.**

**The ecosystem has spoken.**
