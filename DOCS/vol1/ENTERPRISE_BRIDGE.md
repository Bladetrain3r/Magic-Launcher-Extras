The Integration Insight

The paradigm's intended wisdom isn't to reject all architecture, but to ensure that the building blocks of that architecture are as simple, decoupled, and pure as possible.

Even if you're building a massive distributed system:
- Each microservice can be < 500 lines
- Each component can be independently testable
- The complexity lives in the orchestration
- The components stay simple
