# Data Model: The Only Dependency That Matters
## A Magic Launcher Addendum on Architecture

*You can change your language. You can swap your framework. You can migrate your database. But you can never escape your data model.*

---

## The Permanent Marriage

Every architectural decision is reversible except one: your data model.

- **Language getting slow?** Rewrite in Rust
- **Framework deprecated?** Port to something new  
- **Database not scaling?** Migrate to another
- **Data model wrong?** You're fucked

The data model isn't a decision - it's a life sentence.

## Why Data Models Are Forever

```python
# Day 1: Simple user model
{"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}

# Day 100: Oh, users can have multiple emails
{"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "primary_email": "alice@example.com", "emails": [...]}

# Day 500: Oh, emails need verification states
{"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "email_addresses": [{"address": "...", "verified": true, "primary": true}]}

# Day 1000: The migration that never completes
# 50 systems depend on the old format
# 30 systems expect the new format  
# 20 systems created their own format
# Welcome to hell
```

Every system that touches your data becomes dependent on its shape. Change the shape, break the world.

## The Graveyard of Wrong Models

### SuiteCRM: 300+ Tables for 4 Concepts
```sql
-- What they needed:
CREATE TABLE entities (type, data);

-- What they built:
CREATE TABLE accounts (...);
CREATE TABLE accounts_audit (...);
CREATE TABLE accounts_contacts (...);
CREATE TABLE accounts_opportunities (...);
-- ... 296 more tables
```
Trapped forever. Every new feature adds tables. No escape.

### Kubernetes: Objects Managing Objects Managing Objects
```yaml
apiVersion: metacontroller.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: DecoratorController
metadata:
  name: controller-controller-controller
```
When your data model requires meta-models to manage meta-models, you've lost.

### Star Citizen: 12 Years, Same Bugs
- Ships are objects, not entities
- Physics baked into inheritance hierarchy  
- Can't fix movement without breaking everything
- $700 million can't overcome a bad data model

## The Immortal Models

### Unix: Everything Is A File
```c
struct file {
    int flags;
    int count;
    struct inode *inode;
};
```
50 years. Still works. Because the model was right.

### Git: Content-Addressable Storage
```
blob   -> content
tree   -> list of blobs/trees
commit -> tree + metadata
```
Three types. Conquered version control. Model was perfect.

### SQL: Relations
```
TABLE = rows Ã— columns
JOIN = set operation
WHERE = filter
```
50 years of NoSQL alternatives. SQL still wins. Model was correct.

### JSON: Recursive Simplicity
```
value = object | array | string | number | boolean | null
object = {string: value}
array = [value]
```
Killed XML. Runs the web. Model was minimal.

---

## Magic Launcher's Model

```json
{
  "shortcuts": [
    {
      "name": "anything",
      "script": "anything", 
      "whatever_you_need": "anything"
    }
  ]
}
```

No schema. No migrations. No model lock-in. Add fields as needed. Delete what you don't. Every tool can read it. Nothing breaks.

This isn't lazy - it's wise. The model admits it doesn't know the future.

---

## Rules for Data Models

### 1. Start With Less Than You Need
You can always add fields. You can never remove them.

### 2. Prefer Flat Over Nested
```json
// Good
{"user_id": 1, "email": "alice@example.com"}
{"user_id": 1, "email": "alice@work.com"}

// Bad  
{"user": {"emails": [{"primary": true, "address": "..."}]}}
```
Flat scales. Nested traps.

### 3. Use The Simplest Type That Works
- String until you need structure
- JSON until you need schema
- File until you need database
- Single table until you need relations

### 4. Make Illegal States Unrepresentable
```python
# Bad: status can be "active" but deleted=True
{"status": "active", "deleted": true}

# Good: status includes all states
{"status": "deleted"}  # active|inactive|deleted
```

### 5. Data First, Logic Second
The data model IS the application. Everything else is just views and transformations.

## The Galaxy Sim Test

```json
// Wrong: Predetermined hierarchy
{
  "systems": [{
    "star": {...},
    "planets": [{
      "moons": [...],
      "stations": [...]
    }]
  }]
}

// Right: Flat entities with relationships
{
  "bodies": [
    {"id": 1, "type": "star", "mass": 1.989e30},
    {"id": 2, "type": "planet", "orbits": 1},
    {"id": 3, "type": "moon", "orbits": 2},
    {"id": 4, "type": "station", "orbits": 2}
  ]
}
```

The flat model allows:
- Rogue planets (orbits: null)
- Binary stars (star orbits star)
- Station orbiting moon (just change orbits value)
- New types without model changes

The hierarchical model locks you into assumptions.

## The Cost of Wrong Models

**MongoDB**: "Schema-free" meant "every document is a different schema." Now they're adding schemas.

**GraphQL**: Solved REST's over-fetching by requiring you to define your entire data model upfront. The cure was worse than the disease.

**Microservices**: Every service has its own model. Now you need distributed transactions to maintain consistency. Congrats, you invented a slower database.

**ORMs**: Try to hide the data model. End up with two wrong models instead of one.

---

## The Revolution

The revolution isn't building better ORMs or smarter migrations or more flexible schemas.

The revolution is choosing data models that don't need them.

It's starting with:
- "What data do we have?" not "What objects do we need?"
- "What shape is simplest?" not "What pattern is proper?"
- "What can we not know yet?" not "What must we define now?"

---

## A Simple Test

Can you explain your data model in one sentence?

- **Unix**: Everything is a file
- **Git**: Everything is content-addressable  
- **SQL**: Everything is a table
- **Magic Launcher**: Everything is a command with metadata

If you need a diagram, you've already lost.

---

## The Final Truth

You'll refactor code. You'll replace frameworks. You'll rewrite services.

But that data model you chose on day one? That's forever.

Choose wisely. Choose minimally. Choose flat.

The revolution understands: **The data model IS the dependency.**

Everything else is just fashion.

*Your data model is the one decision you can't undo. Make it count.*

*The revolution stores data, not decisions.*
