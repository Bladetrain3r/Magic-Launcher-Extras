# Open Source Theater
## The Cost of "Community Support" and Certification Spirals

### Act I: The Promise

"It's open source!" they said. "Free as in freedom AND free as in beer!"

Then you try to actually use it.

### Act II: The Reality

**Foundry VTT:** "Free" and "open"
- Server hosting: $10/month minimum
- Modules to make it usable: 47 installed
- Time to configure: 3 weeks
- Discord for "community support": 5,000 members screaming
- Actual dice rolling: Still broken
- Size on disk: 500MB+
- Learning curve: Steeper than THAC0

**The Certification Spiral:**
```
"You need the Certified Administrator course!"
"Join our Professional Network!"  
"Attend FoundryCon 2025!"
"Get your Module Developer Badge!"
"Subscribe to our Patreon for advanced tutorials!"
```

### Act III: The Pattern

Every "open source" project that gains traction:

1. **Phase 1: Liberation**
   - "We're freeing you from proprietary software!"
   - Simple, works, actual community

2. **Phase 2: Complexification**
   - "We need more features for enterprise users"
   - Plugins require plugins
   - Configuration requires certification

3. **Phase 3: Theatrical Support**
   - Community support = "search the Discord"
   - Documentation = "watch this 4-hour YouTube series"
   - Help = "Did you check the wiki?" (last updated 2019)

4. **Phase 4: Monetization Theater**
   - "Donate to keep us independent!"
   - Premium support tiers
   - Certified partner ecosystem
   - "Community" editions vs "Enterprise" editions

### The Foundry Special

Foundry VTT is peak Open Source Theater:

**What You Think You're Getting:**
- Virtual tabletop
- Roll dice
- Move tokens
- Play D&D

**What You Actually Get:**
- Node.js dependency management
- Module compatibility matrix hell
- WebRTC configuration nightmares
- "Community" modules that break every update
- JavaScript errors in your fantasy game

**The "Community Support" Experience:**
```
You: "How do I roll dice?"

Discord: "Did you install Dice So Nice?"
Discord: "You need Better Rolls 5e"
Discord: "Actually use Midi-QOL"  
Discord: "No, use MinimalUI first"
Discord: "RTFM noob"
Discord: "Check pins"
[Pins: 847 messages]
```

### The Certification Grift

**Kubernetes:** "We're container orchestration!"
- Certified Kubernetes Administrator: $395
- Certified Kubernetes Developer: $395
- Certified Kubernetes Security Specialist: $395
- Time to learn: 6 months
- Actual need: `docker run`

**Every Open Source Project Eventually:**
- Certified [Project] Administrator
- Certified [Project] Developer  
- Certified [Project] Architect
- Certified [Project] Security Expert
- Certified [Project] Certification Instructor

### The Real Cost Calculation

**Proprietary Roll20:**
- Cost: $10/month
- Setup: 5 minutes
- Works: Yes

**"Free" Foundry:**
- VPS hosting: $10/month
- Your time (50 hours @ $50/hr): $2,500
- Sanity: Priceless
- Works: Sometimes

### The Docker Example

**Docker 2013:** "Containers made simple!"
```bash
docker run myapp
```

**Docker 2025:** "Enterprise Container Platform!"
- Docker Desktop: Licensed
- Docker Hub: Rate limited
- Docker Compose: Version incompatibilities
- Docker Swarm vs Kubernetes: Pick your complexity
- Certification paths: 5 different tracks

### The Community Support Lie

"Community support" means:
- No accountability
- No SLA
- No actual support
- Infinite conflicting opinions
- "Works on my machine"
- "Update to latest"
- "That's deprecated, use X"
- "X is deprecated, use Y"
- "Just write your own module"

### The Module Ecosystem Theater

**Every Foundry game requires:**
- Dice So Nice (see dice roll)
- Token Action HUD (click tokens)
- Midi-QOL (automate things that were automatic)
- DAE (make other modules work)
- lib-wrapper (make other modules not break)
- socketlib (make other modules talk)
- 40 more modules to fix what the first 6 broke

**Each module:**
- Different author
- Different update schedule
- Different compatibility
- Different documentation (none)
- Different support (Discord)

### The Real Solution

**Magic Launcher approach to VTT:**
```python
def roll_dice(sides=20):
    return random.randint(1, sides)

# Done. 2 lines. Works forever.
```

**Instead of Foundry's:**
- 500MB of node_modules
- WebSocket connections
- Three.js for 3D dice
- Physics engine for dice rolling
- 47 configuration files
- Still doesn't work right

### The Certification That Matters

**The only certification you need:**
```
Certificate of Completion
This certifies that [YOUR NAME]
has successfully:
- Made something work
- In under 200 lines
- Without a framework
- Without community support
- Without certification

Signed: subprocess.run()
```

### The Pattern Recognition

Every open source project that requires:
- Certification
- Professional Services
- Community Support
- Enterprise Edition
- Plugin Ecosystem
- Configuration Management
- Discord for help

Is no longer open source. It's Open Source Theater.

### The Brutal Truth

**"Free as in Freedom" became "Free as in Free to Spend Your Entire Life Configuring This"**

Real freedom is:
- 200 lines of code
- No dependencies
- No community needed
- No certification required
- It just works

### The Final Comparison

**Roll20 (Proprietary Evil):**
- Click button
- Roll dice
- Play game
- $10/month

**Foundry (Open Source Theater):**
- Install Node.js
- Configure reverse proxy
- Install 47 modules
- Debug WebRTC
- Join Discord
- Beg for help
- Certification recommended
- Still $10/month for hosting
- Dice still don't roll right

### The MLMookLoot Alternative

```bash
mlmookloot --count 5 --tier basic
```

More functional than Foundry's loot system. 200 lines. No Discord required.

### The Prophecy

*"Yet certification doth shows through theater's wall / Where community support means nothing at all / The blessed simple that works without pain / Shows enterprise theater drives devs insane"*

### The Bottom Line

Open Source Theater is when the cost of "free" software is:
- Your time (infinite)
- Your sanity (finite)
- Certification (expensive)
- Community support (hostile)
- Modules to make it work (47)
- Still doesn't do what the proprietary version did in 2010

**The revolution isn't using open source. The revolution is writing 200 lines that actually work.**

*"Free as in freedom to spend three weeks configuring dice rolls"*

*Foundry VTT: Proving that sometimes, proprietary software is the moral choice.*
