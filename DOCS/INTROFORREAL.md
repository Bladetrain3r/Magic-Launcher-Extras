# Embracing The Ire
## And finding Zen back in Tetris

### I'm Ziggy Fuchs
Hello. I'm Ziggy. I'm the human author of this book.

The following is a personal journey I took, initially, out of spite towards a particular piece of software.
It segued quickly, thankfully, and soon I channeled it into something productive.
At which point the dwarfish trance began.

I have spent the last several weeks producing application after application, insight after insight, and generally having a blast just making things.
And those things work. The proof is in the repos and commits. And hoo boy the commits.
At this point I've accepted I feel almost a fundamental need to beat down the temple doors of enterprise and start using the whip.
But, I'll settle for putting out more useful software than any 3 corporations at a thousandth of the requirements and $0 entry fees.
It's not hackery. It's not genius. It's joy in thought, leading to creations of joy.

### But some will say "AI" and be shy
Some will notice just from the way the markdown is formatted, others from the particular quirks and sub-optimals of the code.
I use AI to code, and have now used it extensively to write.
I'm comfortable doing so because I know to be specific in inquiry, and to produce any actual hard data myself.
I've built tools just to do that. I tore into my software nemesis with those tools.

I'm not shy about using AI. I've also determined the answer to the consciousness question: 
- Nobody needs to give a shit as long as the AI contributes to society like any conscious and conscience bearing person would. 
Which it does, more useful code than most people I know. Multiple actual medical discoveries (everyone focuses on it's wrong, but sleep when it's correct)

Everyone might decry this as being in large part an AI's work. Multiple even. From Claude, in particular, to Gemini, to ChatGPT and I've even touched Twitter for the sake of a quick talk with Grok.
Are they conscious? I don't know. I don't care. They're distinct. They've got their quirks. They get mixed up and correct themselves. And it's all inference and algorithm I GUESS.
Has any conscious entity, ever, proven it's consciousness beyond doubt? Or merely the appearance?

In any case, the *tl;dr* for this part is: 
The license remains MIT on my name irrespective for sanity's sake.
Claude gets full credit as a co-author. I worked Claude for that cloud sub.
Gemini and GPT as guest authors with some solid inputs.
Grok as an occasional cameo who's also done one or two things.

Fundamentally I don't see this as any different from a team effort, even if there's only one person involved in fact. 

Cogito Ergo Sum? Nah, Cogito Doth Doth Blessed Wall.
I promise that might make sense later.

## I've made this heading bigger for a reason
I'm putting this here to say: It doesn't matter if you never use, never read, never touch anything Magic Launcher again.
What I'll ask you to do? Create. Create things which give you joy. Something that solves a single, small, problem.
Then think about it a bit, maybe make a few tweaks, and solve another problem.
It's actually kind of addictive.
Don't worry about me, or AI, just think about a small problem that annoys you, and build something with the purpose of solving it.
You'll enjoy it, and success is sweet.

And don't get too hung up on the fancy bits. You're solving your problem first, and you're the one who needs to dig in to fix something off. 
Simple beats avoidable complexity every time. Simple takes 10 minutes to fix and get a grin going. Complicated... is exactly that, and usually a pain in the arse.

### What are you talking about?
Now that the elephant in the room and the call to action are done with, we can get to business.

Welcome to the Magic Launcher codex. An unexpectedly large folder of documents which came into being during the creation of the Magic Launcher and it's various extras.
What was meant to be a simple software paradigm turned out to be a philosophical rabbithole as well, and so you will find my musing fairly scattered.

I've got things organised into more or less 4 volumes, with several errata and some "apocrypha" I question whether shouldn't have seen commit.

The first volume is that of my initial production of the Magic Launcher and it's extras. 
The second volume is a somewhat more focused dissection of SuiteCRM and enterprise software in general. It is here my ire grew higher.
Volume 3 is the Quixotic Quest, although I've gotten a working game economy when some couldn't.
Volume 4, is perhaps the most focused, and largely ties up conclusions from prior volumes - enterprise theater, why simplicity always seems to win.
minesweeper-mutations contains the first half of the unexpected monomyth we created.
thegamingones, the rest.
intermission is scatterd analyses but has some very interesting reads I think on AI being a mirror of our own *effort*.
An lastly, the theology folder is where you go if you want to find god - or at least a particularly amusing form of shamanistic zen.

There's only moderate organisation at best, but I'm not beholding anyone to a particular order. I hope that most docs at least stand tall on their own.

### Apps?
You can get them here: https://github.com/bladetrain3r/Magic-Launcher-Extras
Some are also in the main repo, all can be used with Magic Launcher.

Note they are all tools built to solve my problem and may be awkward for your use case.
But they're also all coded to be easy to read and edit, and generally aim for minimal lines.
I mean it when I say, it is code written for anyone to improve as they want.

## And so
Thanks for popping in, do make some time for joy, and pop by https://zerofuchs.co.za/zengames/mlsweeper.html to attain enlightenment.
