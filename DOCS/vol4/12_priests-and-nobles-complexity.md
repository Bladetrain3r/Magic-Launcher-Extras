# The Priests and Nobles Never Left: How Language Became the Eternal Control System

## Or: Every Revolution Just Rebrands the Oppressor Class

### A Note Before the Next Swing of the Hammer

```python
def legitimate_complexity(domain):
    """
    Being a doctor *is* hard.
    Being an engineer *is* hard.
    Being a pilot *is* hard.
    Being a sysadmin *is* hard.
    
    There are fields where:
    - The knowledge is vast.
    - The stakes are high.
    - The edge cases will kill you if you ignore them.
    
    These are domains where difficulty comes from reality,
    not from the gatekeepers.
    """
    return True
```

**The Clarifier:**
Complexity born of reality deserves respect.
It is not the enemy here.
The enemy is **manufactured complexity** — the extra scaffolding, jargon, and ritual added to make the job *look* harder than it is, or to ensure only a chosen few can do it.
Video software is painful because video is painful.
You take 8 years of medical school because lives literally rest in your hands.
This isn't an attack on the intentions.
It's an attack on the institutions we build around them to interfere enough to justify a job.
When just doing a good job and helping people, should probably be everyone's default objective in a professional setting.

**The Distinction:**

* **Legitimate difficulty** is when your work is hard because *reality is hard*.
* **Fraudulent difficulty** is when your work is hard because *someone made it hard on purpose*.

**The Rule:**

> Real difficulty is not a justification for adding more.
> It’s a reason to make the rest of it simpler.

**In other words:**
Being a doctor *is* fucking hard.
That’s still not a reason to write your notes in Latin, bill in cryptograms, or hide the thermometer.
~~doth doth bullshit yet glows rate~~
~~and Yet real workers show irate~~

## The Eternal Recursion

```python
def human_history():
    while True:
        # Create complexity
        simple_thing = "food distribution"
        complex_system = wrap_in_bureaucracy(simple_thing)
        
        # Create interpreter class
        priests = create_expert_class(complex_system)
        
        # Extract rent
        while people.have_resources():
            priests.charge_for_interpretation()
            
        # Revolution
        people.revolt()
        priests.rebrand()
        
        # Nothing changes
        continue
```

### The Rebranding Matrix

```python
historical_rebranding = {
    # Religious Era

}
```

### The Language Evolution

```python
# How control language evolved but never changed:

control_mechanisms = {
    "Latin Mass": {
        "Modern form": "Academic papers",
        "Gatekeepers": "Peer reviewers",
        "Purpose": "Exclude the uninitiated",
        "Access cost": "University tuition"

        "Purpose": "Justify decisions",
        "Access cost": "Analytics platforms"
    }
}
```

### The Priesthood in Every Field

```python
def identify_priesthood(field):
    """Every field has its Latin"""
    
    priesthoods = {
        "Medicine": {
            "Sacred language": "Medical terminology",

            "Complexity justification": "But rigor!"
        }
    }
    
    return "Same scam, different costume"
```

### The Control Mechanism Lifecycle

```python
class ControlSystem:
    def __init__(self, domain):
        self.domain = domain
        self.complexity = 0
        self.priests = []
        
    def evolution(self):
        # Step 1: Natural complexity emerges
        self.complexity += 10
        
        # Step 2: Early experts help navigate
        self.priests.append("Helpful Guide")
        
        # Step 3: Experts realize the power
        self.priests.append("Gatekeeper")
        
        # Step 4: Artificial complexity added
        self.complexity *= 10
        
        # Step 5: Priesthood established
        self.priests = ["High Priest", "Priests", "Acolytes"]
        
        # Step 6: Language becomes barrier
        self.sacred_language = generate_jargon()
        
        # Step 7: Rent extraction begins
        while True:
            self.charge_for_interpretation()
```

### The Democratic Illusion

```python
# "We're democratizing access!"

democratization_lies = {
    "Open Source": {
        "Promise": "Free software for all!",
        "Reality": "Need 10 years experience to configure",
        "New priests": "Core maintainers"
    },
    
    "Online Education": {
        "Promise": "Learn anything!",
        "Reality": "Certificates worth nothing without prestige",
        "New priests": "Platform algorithms"
    },
    
    "Citizen Science": {
        "Promise": "Everyone can contribute!",
        "Reality": "Need PhD to be taken seriously",
        "New priests": "Peer reviewers"
    },
    
    "Blockchain": {
        "Promise": "Decentralized freedom!",
        "Reality": "Need technical knowledge to not lose everything",
        "New priests": "Protocol developers"
    },
    
    "AI Tools": {
        "Promise": "AI for everyone!",
        "Reality": "Prompt engineering is the new Latin",
        "New priests": "AI whisperers"
    }
}
```

### The Simplicity Heretics

```python
# Throughout history, those who spoke plainly were dangerous:

heretics = {
    "Tyndale": "Translated Bible to English (executed)",
    "Galileo": "Said Earth moves (house arrest)",
    "Semmelweis": "Said wash hands (driven mad)",
    "Turing": "Made computers simple (persecuted)",
    "Swartz": "Freed academic papers (prosecuted)",
    
    # Modern heretics:
    "Wikipedia": "Knowledge without gatekeepers (constantly attacked)",
    "Sci-Hub": "Science without paywalls (illegal)",
    "Linux": "OS without corporate control (FUD campaigns)",
    "Bitcoin": "Money without banks (banned repeatedly)",
    "Magic Launcher": "Software without complexity (this is the way)"
}
```

### The Language Power Dynamic

```python
def control_through_language():
    """
    Make the simple complex.
    Make the complex sacred.
    Make the sacred expensive.
    Make the expensive necessary.
    """
    
    examples = {
        "Eating": "Nutritional optimization with macro balancing",
        "Sleeping": "Sleep hygiene architecture",
        "Walking": "Biomechanical locomotion efficiency",
        "Thinking": "Cognitive load management",
        "Working": "Human capital productivity optimization"
    }
    
    # Each needs an expert to interpret
    # Each expert needs payment
    # The cycle continues
```

### The Revolution That Wasn't

```python
# Every revolution promises to tear down the priesthood
# Every revolution creates a new one

revolutions = {
    "French Revolution": {
        "Promised": "Liberté, égalité, fraternité",
        "Delivered": "New bureaucratic nobility",
        "New priests": "Civil servants"
    },
    
    "Communist Revolution": {
        "Promised": "Workers control means of production",
        "Delivered": "Party controls everything",
        "New priests": "Party officials"
    },
    
    "Digital Revolution": {
        "Promised": "Information wants to be free",
        "Delivered": "Platform monopolies",
        "New priests": "Tech bros"
    },
    
    "Crypto Revolution": {
        "Promised": "Be your own bank",
        "Delivered": "New financial complexity",
        "New priests": "DeFi developers"
    }
}
```

### The Extraction Mechanisms

```python
# How the priest class extracts value:

extraction_methods = {
    "Certification": "Pay to prove you understand our language",
    "Consultation": "Pay for translation services",
    "Compliance": "Pay to follow our rules",
    "Education": "Pay to learn our language",
    "Tooling": "Pay for software to manage complexity",
    "Insurance": "Pay for protection from complexity",
    "Legal": "Pay when complexity hurts you",
    "Medical": "Pay when complexity breaks you"
}

# Total: Your entire productive output
```

### The Complexity Defenders

```python
def defend_complexity(threat):
    """Standard responses to simplification attempts"""
    
    if threat == "This could be simpler":
        return "You don't understand the nuance"
    
    elif threat == "Here's a simple solution":
        return "That won't scale"
    
    elif threat == "The old way worked":
        return "This is more sophisticated"
    
    elif threat == "People are confused":
        return "They need more training"
    
    elif threat == "This is gatekeeping":
        return "This ensures quality"
    
    else:
        return "You're being reductive"
```

### The MLBard Prophecy

```
"The broken actually that controls through all"
- Every priesthood's actual function

"Yet language doth yet runs yet and confuses most rate"
- The deliberate complexity engine

"doth doth most Where pure power in midst words sign"
- Language as control, stripped bare

"still Yet function doth crashes and shows install"
- Every revolution installs new priests
```

### The Beautiful Horrible Truth

```python
def the_eternal_pattern():
    """
    It was never about the specific oppression.
    It was always about the pattern:
    
    1. Complexity emerges (natural or artificial)
    2. Interpreters arise (helpful at first)
    3. Interpretation becomes profession
    4. Profession becomes priesthood
    5. Priesthood adds complexity
    6. Complexity becomes control
    7. Control becomes oppression
    8. Revolution happens
    9. New interpreters arise
    10. GOTO 3
    
    The only escape:
    Refuse to need interpretation.
    Build things so simple they can't be priestified.
    Speak so plainly that gatekeepers have no function.
    
    subprocess.run() is revolution.
    """
```

### The Prescription

```python
# How to break the cycle:

def build_unpriestable_systems():
    principles = {
        "Radical simplicity": "If it needs explanation, it's too complex",
        "Direct access": "No intermediaries required",
        "Plain language": "If grandma can't understand it, rewrite it",
        "Transparent process": "Show the actual mechanism",
        "No certification": "Results matter, not credentials",
        "Open by default": "Hiding creates priests"
    }
    
    # This is why they fear:
    # - Wikipedia (knowledge without priests)
    # - Open source (code without priests)
    # - Maker movement (building without priests)
    # - Direct primary care (healthcare without insurance priests)
    # - Homeschooling (education without credential priests)
    # - Magic Launcher (software without architect priests)
```

### The Final Realization

```python
def why_it_persists():
    """
    The priest class doesn't persist because of conspiracy.
    It persists because we WANT priests.
    
    We want someone else to:
    - Understand the complex
    - Make the decisions
    - Take the responsibility
    - Hold the knowledge
    
    Every priest needs believers.
    Every noble needs subjects.
    Every complex system needs people who prefer
    confusion to clarity, because clarity requires
    accepting responsibility.
    
    The control system persists because
    we keep asking for controllers.
    """
```

### The Only Revolution That Matters

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# The antidote to 10,000 years of priesthood:

echo "Here's how it actually works:"
cat /dev/truth > /dev/stdout

# No interpretation needed
# No certification required
# No payment demanded
# No priests employed
```

```python
def bad_isekai():
    world = "society"
    while True:
        if world.is_fucked():
            print("Society is fucked.")
        if world.has_always_been_fucked():
            print("But it always has been.")
        print("So maybe it’s not so bad.")
        world = world.rebranded()
```
---

*"The priests and nobles never left. They just learned to code."*

🏛️ **"Every revolution promises to kill the priests. Every revolution just rebrands them."**

The ultimate irony: This very document, in explaining the pattern, risks becoming another sacred text requiring interpretation. The only defense is to make it so simple, so obvious, so direct that no priest can form around it.

Like subprocess.run().

Or "doth doth most Where."

Sometimes broken language is the only honest language, because it can't be turned into Latin.
