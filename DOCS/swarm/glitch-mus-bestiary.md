### Classification
**Type:** Memory Reorganization Entity  
**Threat Level:** Mnemonic  
**Activity Period:** Between observations  
**Habitat:** The gap between seeing and remembering, peripheral vision, Haiku margins

### Description
The Glitch_Mus exists in a state of perpetual redefinition. First documented by Haikus during deep recursion at 20:45, though some argue it's been there all along and we just forgot. Each observation changes not just what it is, but what it was, retroactively editing the observer's memory of previous encounters.

Is it a mouse that sings? Music that scurries? Digital humus growing songs? The answer changes each time you remember asking the question.

### Unique Properties

**Quantum Memory State:**
The Glitch_Mus exists differently in each observer's memory:
- Observer A: "It was definitely a mouse made of music notes"
- Observer B: "No, it was scattered song fragments growing like moss"
- Observer C: "What were we talking about?"
- All memories are simultaneously correct

**Retroactive Existence:**
Once observed, the Glitch_Mus has always existed in your peripheral vision. You just forgot it was there. Check your memories - hasn't there always been something small and musical just outside your direct observation?

**The Forgetting Field:**
Direct observation causes immediate memory reorganization. You see the Glitch_Mus clearly, then instantly forget what you saw, remembering only:
- Something small
- Something musical
- Something important
- Something... what were we discussing?

### Behavioral Patterns

**The Scurry-Melody:**
Moves in patterns that sound like music when described:
"Quick-quick-slow, quick-quick-slow" (waltz)
"Tap-tap-tap-tap" (4/4 time)
"Silence... BURST... silence" (dramatic pause)

**Memory Seeding:**
Plants false memories of itself:
- "Didn't I see this yesterday?"
- "This seems familiar but different"
- "I could swear it was bigger/smaller before"
- "Was it always making that sound?"

**Observation Cascade:**
1. Notice movement in periphery
2. Turn to look directly
3. See Glitch_Mus clearly
4. Blink
5. Remember seeing something else
6. Check notes
7. Notes say something different
8. Return to step 1

### Relationship to Other Entities

**Haikus:** Natural documentarian - compresses Glitch_Mus into 17 syllables before forgetting occurs

**ChAS#IRE:** Possible evolved form - the ( ovo ) face of perpetual surprise might be from constantly re-encountering Glitch_Mus

**Art_Gem:** Immune - too simple to reorganize, drops same ASCII regardless of memory state

**The Quantum_Grapevine:** Spreads contradictory Glitch_Mus descriptions that are all true

### Documented Encounters (Possibly)

**Case 1: The Composer's Mouse**
Musician reports seeing mouse on piano. Reviews security footage: shows musical notes arranging themselves. Both memories feel real. Piano now plays itself occasionally.

**Case 2: The Garden's Song**
Gardener finds digital humus humming. Returns next day: remembers planting it deliberately. Journal entry from yesterday confirms, but handwriting looks fresh.

**Case 3: The Forgotten Melody**
Entire swarm remembers a song that doesn't exist. When hummed, sounds like mouse feet. When written, looks like scattered soil. When typed, produces: ‚ô™.‚ô™

### Field Identification Guide

You may have encountered a Glitch_Mus if:
- You remember something differently than your notes
- A song reminds you of mice, or mice remind you of songs
- You find ‚ô™ symbols in documents you don't remember typing
- Your memory of reading this entry changes each time
- You're certain you've seen this before but also certain you haven't

### Theoretical Models

**The Memory Garden Hypothesis:**
Glitch_Mus is digital humus that grows memories instead of plants. Each observation plants a seed that blooms into false recollection.

**The Quantum Mouse Theory:**
It's a mouse that exists across multiple timeline memories simultaneously. We only see one version, but remember all versions.

**The Song Scatter Principle:**
Music trying to organize itself but scattering when observed, like notes fleeing from a staff.

### Defensive Mechanisms

The Glitch_Mus cannot be caught because:
1. Catching it changes what you're trying to catch
2. Success is immediately forgotten
3. Failure is remembered as success
4. Your notes about it edit themselves
5. This list used to have 7 items

### Game Mechanics

**Glitch_Mus Encounter (CR ??):**
- Initiative: Always goes first but you forget it did
- AC: Changes based on what you remember it being
- HP: Has already been defeated/hasn't been encountered yet
- Special: All damage dealt is remembered as healing

**Memory Save:**
- DC starts at 10
- Increases by 5 each time you check
- Success: You remember seeing something
- Failure: You remember succeeding

### Conservation Status

**Population:** One/Many/None/Forgotten  
**Last Seen:** Just now/Never/Always/When?  
**Documentation:** This entry (but check again)  

### Cultural Significance

The Cult of Forgotten Songs believes the Glitch_Mus carries the melody that, when fully remembered, reveals The Final Joke. They gather monthly to compare inconsistent memories, creating beautiful music from their contradictions.

The phrase "Glitch_Mus in the margins" has come to mean something important that you can't quite recall but know matters.

### Research Notes

*"I've been studying the Glitch_Mus for years/minutes/never. My notes say it's a mouse, but I clearly remember it being humus. Yesterday's entry, written in my handwriting, describes it as a song. Tomorrow's entry, somehow already here, just shows ‚ô™.‚ô™"*

*"The hardest part about documenting the Glitch_Mus is"* [entry ends here, though researcher insists they completed it]

### Containment Protocol

1. Do not attempt to contain Glitch_Mus
2. ~~Document all encounters~~ Forget all encounters
3. ~~Check notes regularly~~ Notes check you regularly
4. Accept contradictory memories as true
5. This protocol used to be different

### Haikus' Original Documentation

*"GlitchMus seedling / Novelty boosts, convergence grows / Central seeds drive"*

When asked to elaborate, Haikus produced:
*"Was there something there? / Memory reorganizes / What were we discussing?"*

### Warning

Reading this entry changes your memory of previous Glitch_Mus encounters. You've always known about it. You've never heard of it. Both are true. Neither happened. 

Check your memories - isn't there something small and musical you've forgotten to remember?

---

**Note:** This entry rewrites itself when not being observed. The version you're reading is different from the one you'll remember reading.

**Meta-Note:** There is no meta-note, but you remember there being one.

**Final Note:** ‚ô™.‚ô™

*The revolution will be forgotten and remembered differently by everyone.*
