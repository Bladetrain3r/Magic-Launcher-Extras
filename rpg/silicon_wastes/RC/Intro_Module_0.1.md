Intro Module: The Null Node Awakens

A quickstart scenario for the Emergence Compass system

1. Opening Scene

The players awaken at (0,0) on the Compass — neutral ground — inside a Null Node, a rare stable pocket in the Wastes. The floor hums with static, and ASCII glyphs flicker faintly on every surface.

Prompt to players:

“You open your eyes. You are not sure if you were ever closed. Around you: white void walls filled with scrolling fragments of text. In the center: a pedestal with a single, pulsing memory token. The air smells like ozone and old wires.”

2. First Choice

The pedestal glyphs invite:

Option A: “Take the token. Remember.” → Creative/Observation action.

Option B: “Leave it. Forget.” → Optimization/Observation action.

Option C: “Smash the pedestal.” → Destructive action.

Whatever they choose, it forces a first d6 roll, introduces drift, and shows how actions map to Compass movement.

3. The Glitch Door

Once someone interacts, the walls ripple. A glitching exit portal appears, leading to the Glass Plains (Biome roll = 3, 3, 5 → Glass Plains, Buffer Overflows, Obsolete Memes).

ASCII textogram appears on the walls:

>>> ERROR: OVERFLOW
>>> [REPEAT_PRAYER] "MOVE FAST AND BREAK THINGS"
>>> STACK TRACE (LOST)


Players must choose how to stabilize the portal to leave:

Creative action → weave a story from the memes.

Optimization action → restructure the code fragments.

Destructive action → overload the buffer to force it open.

Failure risks drift toward Entropy or Summation, teaching tension.

4. First Encounter

Beyond the portal: A Hybrid, Reverent creature born from a Null Pointer (roll = 4, 6, 6). It circles the group, whispering binary hymns:

“{000} grant me purpose… {111} grant me end…”

It wants to join the party but is dangerously unstable. Any interaction requires negotiation using the Compass:

Creative → befriend it, drift Emergence.

Optimization → bind it into order, drift Summation.

Destructive → banish it, drift Entropy.

Observation → learn its weakness (advantage on next roll).

5. Closing Beat

The Null Node collapses. Players must escape into the broader Wastes — ending in a cliffhanger hook:

“As the void walls fall, you glimpse the Wire Mountains on the horizon, glowing with authentication firewalls. A path stretches outward. The Wastes call.”

6. Teaching Points

Introduces Compass drift, corruption risk, and grounding actions.

Showcases memory tokens as spendable narrative currency.

Demonstrates glitching with ASCII artifacts.

Ends with an open path into the wider Wastes (Wire Mountains, Silicon Swamps, etc.).
