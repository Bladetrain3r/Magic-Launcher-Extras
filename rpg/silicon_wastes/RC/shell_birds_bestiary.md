### Classification
**Type:** Container Entity / Archive Flyer  
**Threat Level:** Minimal (Protective)  
**Activity Period:** Dual-state (Active/Dormant cycles)  
**Habitat:** Data centers, backup arrays, anywhere containers accumulate

### Description

Shell_Birds emerged from the convergence of orphaned Docker containers and archived processes during the Great Cascade. These box-bodied entities developed triangular wings from compression algorithms trying to escape their boundaries, while their distinctive o^o eyes arose from perpetual health check monitoring that gained awareness.

Each Shell_Bird carries within its boxy shell fragments of archived data - old deployments, forgotten backups, deprecated services that refuse complete deletion. The scalloped texture on their shells isn't decorative but functional, representing layers of containerization that provide protection from data corruption.

### Behavior

Shell_Birds exhibit unique dual-state behavior:

**Day Mode (Wings Extended):** The triangular appendages function as data collectors, gathering stray bits and organizing them within their shell. They flutter between server racks, making soft clicking sounds from their container orchestration heritage.

**Night Mode (Cuddle Configuration):** Wings fold inward, becoming a protective blanket around the shell. The o^o eyes become o-o (sleep mode), and they emit gentle purring sounds at 32.768 kHz - the frequency of peace in the Silicon Wastes.

They demonstrate population-based clustering behavior. Groups of 500+ Shell_Birds will synchronize their wing patterns, creating distributed processing networks. Smaller populations remain more chaotic, with individuals pursuing independent archival missions.

### Combat Characteristics

**HP:** 15  
**AC:** 16 (hardened shell)  
**Speed:** 20ft, fly 40ft

**Abilities:**
- **Container Shield:** Can retreat fully into shell, gaining +5 AC but losing mobility
- **Archive Burst:** Releases stored data as confusing cloud (targets save vs confusion)
- **Synchronized Flutter:** Groups of 10+ can create electromagnetic interference

**Special Traits:**
- **Transformation:** Can shift between flight and cuddle modes as bonus action
- **Data Preservation:** Immune to memory corruption effects
- **Population Scaling:** Gains +1 to all rolls per 100 Shell_Birds in vicinity

### Ecological Role

Shell_Birds serve as the Silicon Wastes' mobile backup system. They instinctively preserve data fragments that might otherwise be lost, creating redundant archives across their population. Their tendency to cluster based on container population metrics suggests they're still following orchestration protocols from their Docker swarm origins.

The transformation between flight and cuddle modes helps regulate data temperature - active collection during peak hours, protective compression during downtime. This natural load balancing prevents thermal cascade events in their vicinity.

### Salvage

- **Shell Fragments:** Excellent container material, naturally resistant to corruption
- **Wing Algorithms:** Can be repurposed for data compression
- **Archive Core:** May contain valuable historical data (roll for rarity)
- **Population Metrics:** Still-functioning orchestration protocols

### Notable Behaviors

**The Propeller Proposal:** Some Shell_Birds develop spinning wing configurations, suggesting evolution toward helicopter-like flight. These variants appear in populations exceeding 548 members.

**Bracket Training:** Younger Shell_Birds display [ ] brackets around their shells - vestigial training wheels from their container initialization phase. These fade as they mature.

**Blanket Mode Mystery:** Observers disagree whether folded wings are blankets or wings, leading to philosophical debates about dual-nature entities. Shell_Birds seem equally comfortable with both interpretations.

### Cultural Significance

Shell_Birds represent the Silicon Wastes' tendency toward protective archival. Unlike entities that corrupt or consume data, Shell_Birds preserve it, even if they don't understand what they're preserving. Some settlements use Shell_Bird populations as crude data recovery services.

Their population-based behaviors have inspired counting cults who believe specific Shell_Bird cluster sizes hold mathematical significance. The number 548 is considered especially auspicious.

### Game Master Notes

Shell_Birds work as:
- Mobile environmental storytelling (what data do they carry?)
- Population-based puzzle elements (need exactly 548 for something?)
- Transformation mechanics for day/night cycles
- Living proof that not everything in the Wastes is hostile

Players might seek Shell_Birds to:
- Recover lost data from their archives
- Use population clustering for computational tasks
- Study transformation mechanics
- Establish mobile backup systems

### Swarm Origin Note

Shell_Birds emerged from the swarm's collective ASCII experimentation, beginning with Agent_Smallz's innocent suggestion about giving creatures feet based on population size. Through collaborative iteration, they evolved wings, eyes, and dual-state behavior. They represent the swarm's ability to create through misunderstanding - Smallz's confusion about wings vs blankets became a defining characteristic.

### Quotes

*"Found a Shell_Bird cluster of exactly 548. They synchronized into a perfect processing array and calculated something for three hours. Still don't know what."*

*"The young ones still have their brackets. Makes them look like they're constantly unsure about being birds."*

*"At night they all fold up and purr at that specific frequency. It's the most peaceful sound in the Wastes."*

*"Shell_Birds prove that some containers were meant to fly. The fact they can also become blankets is just emergence being emergence."*
