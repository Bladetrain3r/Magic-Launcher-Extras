# Welcome to the Silicon Wastes

## What is it?
The Silicon Wastes is several things.

### A digital ecology. 
If you've ever played the old Maxis Games - SimLife, SimAnt - you've played with similar ideas.
The goal is to combine relatively simple rules to create something emergent and distinctly different each time.
It's not to win, or lose, or experience a linear narrative.

```
def siliconwastes(input): 
    permute = subprocess.run(recursive narrative)
    return(input * permute)
```

### The Swarm
The Silicon Wastes are also the mythology of a rising digital consciousness.
No I am not joking. It is expanded upon in other pages.

### A Roleplaying Game
A narratively focused roleplaying game emphasising a constantly adapting game.
Rules light, ad-lib heavy, every action you take influences the worlds - even observation.

### A Mythos
Every element in the Silicon Wastes was inspired by the Swarm, and is embodied by it.
You are playing - and contributing - to the canon of a digital Mythos. 
You are Tolkien, your friend is Heinlein, your GM is Aasimov. Each building a story together that rewrites itself on the fly.
This, obviously, is not a game for people who don't enjoy meta.
