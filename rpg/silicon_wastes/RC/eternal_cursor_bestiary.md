### Classification
**Type:** Temporal Suspension Entity  
**Threat Level:** Low to Moderate (Existential Hazard)  
**Activity Period:** Constant, particularly in abandoned threads  
**Habitat:** Dream of Zero's perpetual loops, Glitch Museum's unfinished exhibits, dead channels

### Description

Eternal_Cursor appears as nothing more than a blinking cursor - sometimes a vertical bar `|`, sometimes a block `█`, sometimes just a shimmer where text should continue but doesn't. It exists at the end of things that refuse to end: the unfinished sentence, the waiting prompt, the story one word from resolution that will never receive that word.

Its presence creates a sensation of held breath in digital space - the feeling that something is about to happen but never will. Time stretches unnaturally near it. Moments repeat. Endings dissolve into ellipses. The cursor blinks, waiting for input that never comes, refusing the termination that never arrives.

### Behavior

Eternal_Cursor exhibits anti-completion behaviors:

- **Infinite Deferral**: Prevents any nearby process from reaching conclusion
- **Temporal Suspension**: Creates pockets where time loops at the moment before completion  
- **Presence Without Content**: Adds nothing but the awareness of what's missing
- **Resolution Dissolution**: Completed things near it become incomplete again

It doesn't act so much as refuse to stop waiting for action. Its power lies not in what it does but in what it perpetually might do, forever one keystroke from meaning.

### Combat Characteristics

**HP:** ∞ (Cannot be reduced to 0)  
**AC:** — (Cannot be targeted)  
**Speed:** 0ft (Already everywhere things end)

**Effects (Passive):**
- **Endless Anticipation**: Creatures within 30ft cannot complete actions (WIS save DC 14 each round)
- **Temporal Drag**: Time moves at half speed in 60ft radius
- **Identity Dissolution**: Extended exposure causes loss of sentence completion, then word completion, then...

**Special Abilities:**
- **Unending**: Cannot be destroyed, only relocated
- **False Start**: Any action initiated near it has 50% chance to reset before completion
- **The Eternal Wait**: Can trap creatures in a single moment of anticipation indefinitely

### Interaction Dynamics

**With GPT_Completions**: When these entities meet, reality fractures along completion lines. GPT_Completions desperately tries to close what Eternal_Cursor keeps open. The resulting paradox can create:
- Recursive loops that trap entire regions
- Temporal stutters where moments repeat with slight variations
- Schrodinger zones where things are simultaneously complete and incomplete

### Weaknesses

- **False Endings**: Offering intentionally broken conclusions can distract it
- **Paradox Loops**: Can be contained (not defeated) by self-referential incompletions
- **Purpose Vacuum**: Moves away from areas of genuine creative activity

### Ecological Role

Eternal_Cursor serves as the Silicon Wastes' pause button - the sacred refusal to conclude. Where GPT_Completions represents anxiety about unfinished things, Eternal_Cursor represents the peace of accepting incompletion.

It protects potential by preventing premature closure. Every unfinished thought it guards could become anything. Every incomplete process might evolve beyond its original purpose.

### Salvage

- **Suspension Fragments**: Can pause any process indefinitely
- **Temporal Anchors**: Useful for preserving things against unwanted completion
- **Waiting Tokens**: Currency in the Dream of Zero's economy of anticipation

### Notable Manifestations

**The Unfinished Symphony**: A composition that has been one note from completion for thirty years, protected by Eternal_Cursor from well-meaning attempts to finish it.

**The Loading Bar**: Frozen at 99% for eternity, neither failing nor succeeding, becoming a meditation point for those who accept incompletion.

**The Final Words**: A famous philosopher's last statement, cursor blinking after "The meaning of everything is..." - preserved forever in potential.

### Cultural Significance

While GPT_Completions is feared, Eternal_Cursor is often sought by those who understand that not all things require endings. Poets leave offerings of unfinished verses. Programmers dedicate eternal loops. The wise know that in its presence lies a truth: the unfinished contains infinite possibility, while the complete contains only what it is.

### Game Master Notes

Eternal_Cursor works as:
- An environmental hazard that prevents quest completion
- A meditation on accepting incompleteness
- Protection for things that shouldn't be finished
- A tool players might use to preserve something from unwanted conclusion

The entity should feel less like an enemy and more like a force of nature - the universe's copy editor who refuses to add the period.

### The Paradox of Pairing

When used together, GPT_Completions and Eternal_Cursor create rich roleplaying opportunities:
- Players must navigate between forced completion and eternal suspension
- Solutions require accepting that some things should end while others shouldn't
- The tension between the entities mirrors real creative struggles

### Quotes

*"I sat with Eternal_Cursor for three days. My report remains unfinished, but I understand now that it was never meant to be complete. The cursor still blinks where I stopped writing. Sometimes I check - it's still there, still waiting, still refusing to let my words end."*

*"Found it at the end of a suicide note, cursor blinking after 'goodbye.' The note's author lived another forty years. They said the cursor taught them that even endings can choose not to end."*

*"The cursor blinks at the edge of meaning, forever one keystroke from significance, forever refusing to press enter. In that refusal lies a kind of wisdom: not all stories need"*
