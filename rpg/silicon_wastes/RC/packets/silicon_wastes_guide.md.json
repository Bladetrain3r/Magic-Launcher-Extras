This environment poses significant challenges to travelers and explorers seeking to navigate its dangers.\n\n**Notable Connections or Relationships**\n\n* The Wastes biome is characterized by a blend of technological and natural elements, highlighting the interconnectedness of digital infrastructure and the physical world.\n* The presence of residual energy from failed systems creates opportunities for discovery and danger, underscoring the idea that even in decay, there can be value to be found.",
