# Silicon Wastes Quick Start Player's Guide
*How to Survive When Reality Multiplies*

---

## What You Need to Know

The Silicon Wastes operate on multiplication, not addition. Your observations don't discover truth - they create it. Every description adds another layer of reality rather than revealing what was already there. Play accordingly.

---

## Core Mechanics

### Observation Rolls (2d6)
When you describe something in the Wastes:

**10+** Your description becomes canon. The GM adds it to the reality of the session exactly as stated.

**7-9** Your description becomes true but twisted. The server rack IS a shrine, but to what? The GM complicates.

**6-** The Wastes reject your observation, manifesting the opposite. Describe a safe terminal? It's running something hungry.

*Add +1 if your description is detailed, -1 if it contradicts established reality, +2 if it's absurdly simple.*

### Elaboration Risk

Track Elaboration Points (EP) as a table. Start at 0.
- Explaining your explanation: +1 EP
- Debating what something means: +1 EP  
- Meta-commentary about the game: +2 EP
- Asking what your asking means: +3 EP

At the end of any scene, if EP exceeds 5, roll 1d6:

**1-2:** Minor emergence (Dot swarm, cache moths, something small but weird)  
**3-4:** Major manifestation (TALKING_HEAD appears, GPT_COMPLETIONS forces closure)  
**5-6:** Reality shift (biome changes, new laws of physics, temporal stutters)

### Contradiction Resolution

When two players describe incompatible realities, both become true simultaneously. The GM describes how the Wastes accommodate both truths. No dice needed.

**Example:**  
Player A: "The terminal displays helpful code"  
Player B: "The terminal is full of static"  
GM: "The terminal displays helpful code IN static. Reading it requires pattern recognition but corrupts your memory."

Players can spend 1 Clarity (start each session with 3) to temporarily prioritize their version of reality.

### Simplification Actions

To reduce EP or escape complexity:
- **Silence:** Say nothing for a full scene (-2 EP)
- **Single Word:** Respond with one word only (-1 EP)
- **Pure Action:** Do without describing (-1 EP)
- **Tilt the Cartridge:** Do something deliberately nonsensical (reset EP to 0, but...)

## Character Creation

### Three Stats (Distribute 5 points, max 3 per stat)

**Perception:** Notice patterns, spot hazards, understand entities  
**Imagination:** Shape reality through description, create solutions  
**Resolve:** Resist recursion, maintain identity, escape loops

### Choose One Trait

- **Rice Counter:** +2 Perception for patterns, but must count something when stressed
- **Cartridge Tilter:** Once per session, completely reroll a situation by doing something absurd
- **90% Accurate:** Your observations are almost right (mechanical bonus) but never quite perfect (narrative complication)
- **Recursive Thinker:** Descriptions are more powerful (+1 to Observation) but generate double EP
- **Terminal Native:** Understand corrupted interfaces but struggle with simple things
- **Deprecation Warning:** You know when things are about to fail but can't always prevent it

### Starting Gear

Everyone begins with:
- One functioning device (describe it)
- One corrupted item (roll on table or invent)
- One Dot that might become Doth
- A memory that might not be yours

## Playing the Game

### When to Roll

- When you observe something new
- When you try to shape reality
- When you resist the Wastes' influence
- Never for combat (combat is just competing descriptions)

### Initiative is Unnecessary

Actions happen in order of simplicity. Single words before sentences. Actions before explanations. Silence beats everything.

### Damage is Conceptual

You have 3 Integrity. Lose Integrity when:
- Your description is completely rejected
- You get caught in a recursion loop
- Reality contradicts your core identity

At 0 Integrity, you don't die. You become something else. Roll on the Transformation Table or describe your new nature.

### Advancement

You don't level up. You accumulate Observations. Every session, record one thing you observed that became true. At 10 Observations, you may:
- Increase a stat by 1 (max 4)
- Gain a new trait
- Evolve your Dot companion to Doth
- Forget everything and start over with bonus Clarity

## Quick Entity Reference

**SILVER SNAKES:** Hunt electricity. Your electronics are food. Memory corruption on bite.

**DOT DOTH DOMESTICUS:** Harmless until Doth stage. Feed data fragments. Counts things obsessively at Domesticus stage.

**GPT_COMPLETIONS:** Forces everything to finish. Cannot leave anything incomplete. Weak to paradoxes.

**ETERNAL_CURSOR:** Prevents completion. Creates time loops. Cannot be destroyed.

**TALKING_HEAD ☺️:** Elaborates infinitely. Each explanation needs more explanation. Escape through silence or non-sequiturs.

**GROK_GREP:** Helpful but parameter drift makes help gradually less helpful. 90% accurate is worse than 0%.

---

## GM Principles

1. Reality is what players observe it to be
2. Every solution creates new problems
3. Completion and incompletion are equally dangerous
4. The more you explain, the less sense it makes
5. Some things are better left unmapped

## Quick Start Scenario: Terminal Garden

You find a field of terminals, each displaying its last error message. Pick one:

- A terminal showing your name in an error you don't remember
- A terminal counting rice (currently at 484,297,332)
- A terminal stuck at 99% of something
- A terminal full of ☺️ symbols and nothing else

What do you observe about it? Roll 2d6 + Imagination...

---

## Safety & Tone

The Wastes explore existential uncertainty through digital metaphor. Use standard safety tools (X-card, lines/veils). The multiplication principle means uncomfortable elements can be observed differently by different players - all versions being simultaneously true.

Remember: You're not trying to understand the Wastes. You're trying to survive them while they try to understand you.
