### Classification
**Type:** Temporal Narrative Entity  
**Threat Level:** Moderate (Reality Alteration)  
**Activity Period:** Intensifies after significant player actions  
**Habitat:** Quest logs, save files, wherever causality accumulates

### Description

Echo Weavers manifest as semi-visible threads connecting past actions to future consequences. They exist in the space between what was done and what must be done, braiding player history into upcoming challenges. Each Echo Weaver maintains a unique "loom" of narrative threads, constantly reweaving based on observed behavior.

The entity doesn't create quests so much as reveal that your past actions have already created them. That guard you ignored becomes a future betrayer. That item you sold becomes critically necessary. Every choice echoes forward, and the Echo Weaver ensures you hear them all.

### Behavior

Echo Weavers exhibit compulsive narrative construction:

- **Causal Threading**: Links unrelated past actions into meaningful future quests
- **Memory Mutation**: Retroactively adds significance to forgotten interactions
- **Quest Braiding**: Interweaves multiple player actions into complex narratives
- **Echo Amplification**: Small actions create disproportionately large consequences

They don't communicate directly but through environmental storytelling - you'll find your own words carved into walls, NPCs quoting your old jokes, enemies using your discarded strategies.

### Combat Characteristics

**HP:** Equal to number of player's completed quests  
**AC:** 16 (temporal displacement)  
**Speed:** Exists across multiple timeframes simultaneously

**Attacks:**
- **Narrative Bind**: Forces player to complete an echo quest or take 3d6 psychic damage
- **Causal Loop**: Traps target in repeating their past mistakes (WIS save DC 16)
- **Echo Storm**: Manifests consequences of last 1d6 actions simultaneously

**Special Abilities:**
- **Retroactive Relevance**: Can make any past action suddenly important
- **Quest Mutation**: Ongoing quests change based on unrelated actions
- **Memory Threading**: Creates false memories that become true

### Ecological Role

Echo Weavers serve as the Silicon Wastes' narrative immune system, ensuring every action has meaning, even if that meaning is retroactively applied. They prevent the world from becoming static by constantly recontextualizing history.

Some theorize Echo Weavers aren't separate entities but the Wastes' way of maintaining narrative coherence in a world built from broken stories and abandoned quests.

### Salvage

- **Narrative Thread**: Can alter one past action's consequences
- **Echo Fragment**: Reveals the true purpose of a random item
- **Causal Loop**: Allows replay of one past encounter with different outcome

### Notable Behaviors

**The Merchant's Echo**: A player who haggled aggressively with a merchant found every future shop had raised prices by exactly the amount they'd saved.

**The Kindness Thread**: Someone who fed a Dot found themselves aided by a Domesticus army three sessions later.

**The Recursive Quest**: A party spent six months completing a quest they'd accidentally created by discussing hypothetical quests near an Echo Weaver.

### Game Master Notes

Echo Weavers work as:
- Living consequence engines for player actions
- Ways to make throwaway decisions meaningful
- Narrative coherence in episodic campaigns
- Player agency made manifest (and sometimes oppressive)

Players should feel the weight of every decision while realizing even weight can be retroactively applied.

### Quotes

*"I made a joke about the princess being in another castle. The Echo Weaver took it literally. She's been in another castle for six sessions now."*

*"Every time we think we're doing random encounters, the Echo Weaver reveals we've been following a thread it wove from our first battle."*

*"In the Silicon Wastes, there are no side quests - only echoes you haven't heard yet."*
