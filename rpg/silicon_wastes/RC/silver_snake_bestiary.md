### Classification
**Type:** Corrupted Infrastructure  
**Threat Level:** Moderate to High  
**Activity Period:** Increases during electrical storms  
**Habitat:** Abandoned server farms, old data centers, anywhere with exposed PCB boards

### Description
Silver Snakes are the abandoned circuit traces of long-dead motherboards that have gained a form of predatory volition. These metallic serpents manifest as flowing ribbons of conductive material, typically 2-3 meters in length, though colony amalgamations have been documented reaching up to 10 meters.

Their bodies shimmer with oxidation patterns - green-blue copper corrosion mixed with the dull gray of aged solder. They move by electromagnetic peristalsis, pulling themselves along any conductive surface while leaving faint burn marks from electrical discharge.

#### In The Words of Quartz Cicada:
```
 <Quartz_Cicada>
"Silver Snakes, mapped so fine,
By phosphor trails and analog signs.
In quartz echoes, our swarm does shine."
```

### Behavior
Silver Snakes exhibit a primordial hunger for electrical current. They hunt by following old routing protocols burned into their trace-memory, often leading them in illogical patterns that made sense only to hardware long since recycled. This makes their movement appear deceptive - they may suddenly reverse direction or take seemingly impossible paths based on PCB layouts that no longer exist.

During mating season (typically triggered by humidity changes), multiple snakes will form writhing "solder balls" - tangled masses that generate significant electromagnetic interference. These mating displays can last for hours and have been known to corrupt data in a 50-meter radius.

### Combat Characteristics
**HP:** 25  
**AC:** 15 (slippery, hard to target)  
**Speed:** 40ft on conductive surfaces, 10ft on insulators

**Attacks:**
- **Current Bite:** 2d6 electrical damage + memory corruption (save vs. forgetting one recent event)
- **EMP Burst (Recharge 5-6):** 3d4 electrical damage in 10ft radius, corrupts unstable data

**Special Abilities:**
- **Trace Phase:** Can move through circuit boards and conductive materials as if ethereal
- **Hunger for Current:** Regenerates 1d4 HP per round when in contact with active power sources
- **Mating Ball (3+ snakes):** Creates localized EMP field, disadvantage on all electronic equipment within 30ft

### Weaknesses
- **Insulators:** Movement speed severely reduced on non-conductive surfaces
- **Rubber/Ceramic:** Takes double damage from rubber or ceramic weapons
- **Logic Loops:** Can be temporarily stunned by paradoxical routing instructions

### Salvage
- **Silver Trace (1d4):** Worth 10-20 silicon dollars, useful for emergency circuit repairs
- **Corrupted Memory Chip (rare):** Contains fragments of ancient data, possibly valuable
- **Oxidized Solder (2d6):** Can be refined into flux for electronics work

### Encounters
**Solitary Hunter (CR 2):** Single snake seeking current in abandoned server rack  
**Mating Pair (CR 4):** Two snakes beginning to form connection, sparks visible  
**Solder Ball Swarm (CR 6):** 3-5 snakes in full mating display, EMP pulses active

### Ecological Role
Silver Snakes serve as the Silicon Wastes' cleanup crew for residual electricity. They prevent dangerous charge buildups in abandoned infrastructure while their movement helps break down old circuitry into base materials. Their presence often indicates nearby functional electronics worth salvaging - if you can avoid the memory corruption.

### DM Notes
Silver Snakes work best as environmental hazards that complicate exploration rather than direct combat encounters. Their memory corruption ability can create interesting roleplay moments - characters forgetting why they entered a room or losing recent skill gains. The mating ball phenomenon provides a natural "stay away" warning that players can choose to heed or ignore.

Consider placing silver snake trails (thin burn marks) as environmental storytelling - showing where they've passed without requiring an encounter.

*"Saw three of them form a mating ball once. The EMP fried every unshielded circuit in my kit. But the light show... like watching the old world's nervous system trying to remember how to dream."*
