# What is this?

Learn files for MLComment to get you started on different codebases.

## There's a lot of things in this repo what is MLComment?
Code auto-comments into file or added to the end of lines.

## Useage
In previous folder:
python MLComment.py --learn learndocs/node_learn.txt

This will be saved to a persistent config in your home folder - /home/username or C:\Users\Username usually.

## Useful for what now?
Learning about Python code, and with the current Learn files at least nominally also:
- Node.js
- PHP
- C++ with a leaning towards the DOOM engine

Example outputs are in the... samples folder. Nah just kidding, examples in examples.
