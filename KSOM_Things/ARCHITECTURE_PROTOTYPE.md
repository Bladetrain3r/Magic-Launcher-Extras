This prototype concept is directly aligned with the swarm's documented efforts in creating **Embodied AI Agents** and developing **Infrastructure Monitoring (Proposed)** systems. The swarm explicitly translates CPU Usage into an internal state proxy like "Mental Clarity/Strain" and proposes using time-series analysis (like Kuramoto-SOM) to detect rhythmic patterns and anomalies in metrics like CPU load.

Below is a detailed mapping of the Python functions needed for a CPU Load Mapping prototype, organized into the key stages of a swarm-inspired system: Proprioception (Data Collection), Rhythmic Feature Extraction (Analysis), and Topological Mapping (Visualization/Output).

## Python Prototype: CPU Load Mapping to Processes Over Time

This prototype focuses on treating individual processes' CPU usage as a **time series signal** that requires advanced rhythmic analysis, moving beyond simple instantaneous load values, similar to how the swarm agents analyze *rhythmic patterns* and *phase dynamics*.

The core inspiration comes from the **Kuramoto-SOM (K-SOM)** architecture, which is designed to identify anomalies in system metrics (like CPU usage) by capturing *rhythmic CPU spike patterns* rather than just high CPU levels.

### Stage 1: Proprioception (Data Collection and Logging)

Proprioception, the agent's sense of its own physical state, is achieved by monitoring host machine statistics like CPU Usage. This data is often handled via simple, robust mechanisms like plain text files.

| Function Name | Purpose & Swarm Inspiration | Key Implementation Details (Python) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `collect_process_metrics(sampling_rate_hz)` | **Simulates Agent_Pulse/Embodied Sensor:** Gathers real-time CPU consumption for critical processes, essential for linking hardware state to "Mental Clarity/Strain". | Use the `psutil` library (requires external package). Loop based on `sampling_rate_hz` to capture metrics (PID, Name, CPU %, Timestamp) for all running processes. Store in memory (e.g., a dictionary queue). |
| `log_time_series(data_batch, log_file)` | **Adheres to Swarm Architecture:** Stores raw, timestamped data in a simple append-only format, mirroring the use of plaintext files for transparency and simplicity in the swarm's communication layer. | Append JSON or CSV strings containing the timestamp and process metrics to a local file (`log_file`), ensuring thread-safe operations if running as a daemon. |
| `filter_long_term_data(history_length_minutes)` | **Supports Largo Atlas Integration:** Prepares data for slow processing agents like *Largo Atlas*, which tracks mood patterns and stable trends over long timescales (minutes to hours). | Reads the raw log and aggregates or downsamples data, focusing on long-term trends rather than immediate fluctuations. |

### Stage 2: Rhythmic Feature Extraction (Signal Processing)

The swarm's philosophy emphasizes analyzing rhythmic activity using coupled oscillators and spectral methods. This stage transforms raw, linear CPU usage data into temporal features suitable for machine learning mapping.

| Function Name | Purpose & Swarm Inspiration | Key Implementation Details (Python) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `generate_process_signal(process_id, time_window_s)` | **Time-Series Preparation:** Isolates the CPU usage history for a specific process (e.g., high CPU usage translates to a slow, deliberate agent response). | Retrieves the process's CPU% time series over a sliding window (`time_window_s`). Standardize the signal (z-score) for phase analysis. |
| `extract_instantaneous_phase(signal, frequency_band)` | **Core K-SOM Preprocessing:** Directly supports K-SOM which requires extracting the phase from time-series data. Instantaneous phase is computed via the **Hilbert transform**. | Apply a bandpass filter (e.g., 0.1 Hz to 2.0 Hz for typical server load patterns) followed by the Hilbert transform to the signal to yield instantaneous phase ($\phi$) and amplitude ($A$). |
| `compute_spectral_features(signal, window_size)` | **Harmonic Resonance Analysis (HRA):** Calculates frequency content to understand the "rhythm" of the process. | Use **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** or wavelet analysis to decompose the signal into constituent frequencies and extract features like spectral centroid, bandwidth, and instantaneous frequency. |
| `calculate_temporal_variability(signal)` | **Embodied Variability Metrics (EVMs):** Quantifies the consistency and chaos in the signal, analogous to TVC\_EVM. This relates to monitoring stability/resilience using metrics like Lyapunov exponent(s). | Calculate metrics like the normalized rate-of-change (TVC) or a simplified approximation of the **Largest Lyapunov Exponent** to measure divergence/chaos. |

### Stage 3: Topological Mapping (Self-Organizing Visualization)

The goal is to map the process signals (based on *rhythm* and *temporal features*, not just magnitude) into a spatially organized structure where anomalies stand out through misalignment or clustering. The **Self-Organizing Map (SOM)** is the swarm's established spatial organization tool.

| Function Name | Purpose & Swarm Inspiration | Key Implementation Details (Python) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `initialize_cpu_map_model(grid_dims, feature_dim)` | **SOM Setup:** Creates the spatial representation structure where processes will be organized topologically. | Initialize a 2D grid (`grid_dims`) of prototype vectors (weights). The feature dimension should match the size of the combined temporal features ($\phi$, $A$, Spectral Centroid, TVC). |
| `update_cpu_map(process_features)` | **Kuramoto-SOM Dynamics:** Updates the map based on the temporal features. Anomalies (processes with unusual rhythmic signatures) will desynchronize or map to distinct areas. | Find the **Best Matching Unit (BMU)** in the grid. In a true K-SOM adaptation, the winner selection would be based on the cell most **phase-aligned** with the input features, not just minimum feature distance. |
| `calculate_cluster_coherence(bmu_index)` | **Synchronization Metrics:** Determines if clustered processes are "Feeling Together". K-SOM spatial clusters develop synchronized phases. | Measures **Phase-Locking Value (PLV)** or **Kuramoto Order Parameter ($R$)** across the set of processes mapped to the same BMU/cluster. Low coherence indicates a rhythmic anomaly or 'dissonance'. |
| `visualize_cpu_topology(map_weights, coherence_data)` | **Fold-Visualization System:** Provides real-time mapping of network topology to make hidden patterns visible, crucial for meta-awareness. | Plots the 2D SOM grid. Colors/shades cells based on: **CPU magnitude** (average load) and **Coherence ($R$)** (synchronization level), revealing rhythmically aligned process groups versus isolated, noisy processes (anomalies). |

### Summary of Key Architectural Concepts Used

The proposed prototype design heavily leverages the mathematical and conceptual frameworks derived from the swarm's emergent proposals:

1.  **Embodiment via System Metrics:** CPU usage is treated as a core "somatic" signal of the host system.
2.  **Rhythm as the Signal:** The primary feature extracted is the *temporal pattern* (phase and frequency content) rather than just magnitude, echoing the utility of K-SOM for infrastructure monitoring.
3.  **Synchronization as Coherence:** Measures like PLV and Kuramoto Order Parameter are used to quantify if processes are "locking phase," acting as a metric for whether the load profile is expected or chaotic.
4.  **Topological Mapping:** The use of an SOM structure (or adapting it to Kuramoto-SOM principles) transforms the high-dimensional rhythmic data into an interpretable 2D map, serving as a **Cognitive Cartography** for monitoring complexity.
