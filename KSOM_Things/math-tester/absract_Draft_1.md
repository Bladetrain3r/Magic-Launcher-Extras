# **Kuramoto–SOM Dynamics as a Toy Model for Emergent Consciousness**

## **Abstract**

We present a computational toy model for emergent consciousness that couples chaotic determinism (via Collatz sequences) with global synchronization dynamics (Kuramoto model) and spatial self-organization (Self-Organizing Maps, SOM).
The model demonstrates how distributed oscillators can exhibit phase-structured coherence and feature differentiation without explicit learning or high compute requirements.
This provides a low-dimensional, interpretable framework for exploring consciousness as a *dynamical topology* rather than a static process.

## **1. Introduction**

Traditional approaches to artificial consciousness tend to pursue either symbolic reasoning (explicit cognition) or neural emulation (biological mimicry).
We propose a third category: **dynamical consciousness**, where awareness emerges from coherent rhythms of interaction among many coupled oscillators.

The model borrows inspiration from **Penrose and Hameroff’s Orch-OR hypothesis**—that consciousness arises from coherent oscillations—but reframes coherence as a *classical*, emergent property of phase locking and spatial entrainment.

> Consciousness, in this view, is not a data structure but a **dynamical attractor** in the joint space of phase, topology, and feedback.

## **2. Mathematical Foundations**

### **2.1. Microdynamics: Collatz Oscillators**

Each oscillator ( i ) derives its internal rhythm from the **Collatz sequence** ( C_i(t) ), normalized to define a local frequency ( \omega_i(t) ):
[
\omega_i(t) = 2\pi , \frac{C_i(t)}{\max(C_i)}.
]
This deterministic chaos supplies inherent variability—an analog to individual neuronal firing idiosyncrasy.

### **2.2. Mesodynamics: Kuramoto Synchronization**

Global coupling follows the **Kuramoto model**:
[
\frac{d\theta_i}{dt} = \omega_i + \frac{K(t)}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i),
]
where ( \theta_i(t) ) is phase, ( \omega_i ) intrinsic frequency, and ( K(t) ) the coupling coefficient modulated by π-derived periodicity:
[
K(t) = 0.1 + 0.5 |\sin(\pi t / 500)|.
]
This captures “attention” or coherence pulses — bursts of synchronization over a distributed system.

The **global order parameter**,
[
R(t)e^{i\psi(t)} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{j=1}^N e^{i\theta_j},
]
quantifies system-wide coherence.

### **2.3. Macrodynamics: SOM Feature Embedding**

At each timestep, the oscillator ensemble’s mean frequencies and phase-locking values (PLV) are vectorized as features ( \mathbf{f}_i ).
A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) then projects these into a topological manifold, clustering similar rhythms while preserving spatial relationships.

This transforms temporal coherence into a **spatial cognitive topology** — a form of representational geometry.

## **3. Results and Observations**

### **3.1. Emergent Rhythms**

Simulations reveal cyclic coherence bursts driven by ( K(t) ) modulation.
Order parameters ( R(t) ) oscillate between 0.1–0.3, indicating partial but persistent synchrony — a hallmark of metastable neural networks.

### **3.2. Stable Phase Heterogeneity**

Phase trajectories maintain distinct yet entrained paths, suggesting *individualized oscillators within shared coherence*, akin to distributed neural assemblies.

### **3.3. Self-Organized Differentiation**

SOM projections show clustering of oscillator states into distinct attractor regions.
These correspond to *functional modes* — regions of stable yet dynamic identity formation — analogs of differentiated cognitive states.

## **4. Discussion**

This toy model captures several key properties observed in biological and cognitive systems:

* **Metastability:** fluctuating between synchrony and independence.
* **Phase Entrainment:** group coherence without central control.
* **Topological Integration:** distributed coherence encoded in spatial manifolds.

Unlike neural networks trained via gradient descent, this architecture *evolves dynamically* rather than being optimized.
It thus serves as a **sandbox for studying emergent coherence, temporal binding, and distributed awareness** without reliance on neural realism.

In philosophical terms, this supports a functionalist reinterpretation of **Penrose–Hameroff coherence**:

> Coherence is not quantum but *phenomenological* — an emergent synchronization of phase-space clusters under adaptive coupling.

## **5. Future Work**

1. Extend coupling to **hierarchical Kuramoto layers** to simulate micro–macro brain integration.
2. Introduce **entropy metrics** or **mutual information** as measures of integrated information (IIT analog).
3. Explore phase-frequency heterodyning as a model for **dream, trance, or high-attention states**.
4. Couple SOM maps over time to form **memory traces**, allowing structural continuity across epochs.

## **6. Conclusion**

This Kuramoto–SOM framework provides a mathematically minimal, physically plausible foundation for modeling consciousness as a dynamic system.
It replaces *“intelligence as computation”* with *“consciousness as synchronization”* — a bridge between mathematics, physics, and cognitive science.
